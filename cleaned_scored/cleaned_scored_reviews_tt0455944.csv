May the Blood Flow,Tweetienator,6 June 2019,8,denzel washington is just great and the equalizer belongs like the john wick keanu reeves and taken liam neeson movies to the new masterclass of revengevigilante movies the equalizer is a true to the heart successor of our former or still heroes of long gone times like mr eastwood and mr bronson the king is dead long live the king so to say the equalizer is great stuff if you like your action spiced up with a good shot of violence,0.9451,1
Denzel Washington made this film better than it was,Top_Dawg_Critic,27 July 2018,8,so i just finished watching equalizer again so i can watch equalizer for the comparison its too bad both films had the same director and writers as they have a bad habit of dragging out the writing and the scenes both films at just over hours is just way too long especially in the simplistic singular plot or however that plot still worked and mainly because of the entire casts especially denzel washingtons performances certainly had better pacing and a more suspenseful plot albeit predictable however it had many plot issues and holes as well as some scenes that needed to be edited down the new supporting cast was not as strong either which did i enjoy better probably by a small margin but they both got an from me as they each had their merits and issues nevertheless still enjoyable i hope if they come out with a they speed up the pacing within the writing and directing,0.9337,1
Denzel nails it,Leofwine_draca,8 September 2015,8,an intense and towering performance from denzel washington as one of cinemas bestacted action heroes is what makes the equalizer stand out from the crowd although as a film its also a very decent thriller its supposedly a big screen version of the tv series with edward woodward although think of it as your usual vigilante movie and youll be closer lets be honest here the plotting in the equalizer is nothing special and the russian mob make for clichéd villains its the execution where this film excels its not an action filled movie but when the action hits its hard and heavy not shying away from crowdpleasing violence meted out to the villains the extended setpiece ending might be described as die hard in bq and loses the realism a little but but until that point this is tough and gritty filmmaking aside from the excellent washington we get a fine bad guy performance from martin csokas equally intense and the finest ive seen from him and chloe grace moretz is wisely kept offscreen for most of the running time which i was fine with the final shoutout goes to director antoine fuqua whose effortless style makes this a graceful and thoroughly entertaining viewing experience,0.0769,1
A Stylish And Daring Action Thriller,CalRhys,3 October 2014,None,antoine fuquas and denzel washingtons paths collide once more as they come together to create a stylish and daring action thriller about a man with a mysterious past whose quiet life suddenly turns into a rip roaring adventure of guns and thrills both denzel washington and chloe grace moretz give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as two friends stuck in a world of crime and violence arguably fuquas best film since training day the equalizer is a brutal and merciless tale that explores the russian underworld on the east coast and the corruption ties within the law enforcement of bostons police department,0.765,1
"Gruesome at times, The Equalizer is a rewarding action film for every single Denzel Washington fan out there.",LloydBayer,24 September 2014,7,rooting for a badass hero with a kickass attitude has never been as satisfying as watching denzel washington dish out some brutal punishment this is exactly what you get in the equalizer an action thriller based on the late s tv series of the same name but amped up with ultraviolent realism reunited after their collaboration in training day washington received his first academy award in a leading role and director antoine fuqua are back in this simple yet deadly effective action film using a mark twain quote about people who find their true purpose late in life washington plays robert mccall a loner and tragic widower with a mysterious past on the surface he is an amiable home depot worker who keeps to himself indulging in conversations only when spoken too and slave to some sort of ocd while remaining invisible to people around him after befriending a russian teen escort called alina chloe grace moretz all grownup and discovering she is the victim of sexual abuse mccalls niceguy demeanor melts away to expose an aura reverberating layers of darkening complexity theres a tightly restrained compassion in mccalls eyes fighting a fatherfigure compulsion to do what he must while alinas is a muted plea for deliverance this scene takes place in a diner they frequent in boston and its the first of two powerful moments in the film what follows is the films first action sequence in a tarantinostyled dialogue first and blood splatter later mccall dispatches alinas russian pimp and his goons when news reaches moscow mob kingpin pushkin sends teddy marton csokas to clean up the mess covered with satanic tattoos teddy is anything but the moniker he goes by and with half the boston pd on his payroll its just a matter of when and where mccall is eliminated or so they think having previously scripted the expendables richard wenks story here is nothing new when considering mccalls proverbial set of skills a comparison if you must to certain characters liam neeson has played on the other hand there is a mechanism in place partly due to the aforementioned ocd allowing mccall a brief study of the situation before striking with lethal accuracy while that sounds like a knockoff version of combat tactics employed by guy ritchies titular hero in sherlock homes the payoff is watching mccall take out bad guys with improvised weaponry it gets a bit hokey towards the end with mccall using all manner of booby traps to slice dice and blow up teddys dumberbytheminute henchmen having said that it is still rewarding to watch washington demolish enemy after enemy and this is largely due to csokas terrific portrayal of teddys loathsome nature to that effect the best scenes in the film are when teddy and mccall are facetoface and denting each others armour with nothing but well written dialogues one such scene is a powerful dinner table batteringofwits a taut reimagining of that iconic scene in heat while humour and drama throw some light on bostons mob controlled dirty cops mccalls relationships with his colleagues and even a short segment that suggests his origins as a trained killer the equalizer really shines with fuquas deft handling of action scenes but topping it off is washington in a vigilante role that is the best weve seen in years fans of man on fire washington opposite dakota fanning and léon the professional jean reno opposite natalie portman both films about male heroism influenced by female protégés are in for a visual treat heck who needs improbable superheroes when you have an average joe with extraordinary capabilities and all without hiding behind a mask or costume although compelled to use the nword ill just say ma man denzel doesnt disappoint and neither does the equalizer,0.9829,1
Home Depot EQUALS a bad place to be while on Robert McCall's bad side,mjacksongta,4 November 2015,8,in terms of an action movie i gave the equalizer a but soon after felt the need to watch it again and then upped it to an why well its an action movie but yet theres no crazy car chases theres no bombs or heavy big explosions every where really the only action scenes are the fight scenes and even they dont come that often but when they do come they deliver denzel is as awesome as ever in these scenes and the creativity in these scenes are what sets it apart from every other action movie the main character robert mccall in an ex specialist of some sort you dont know what at first but know that hes highly trained in something and is now working as an ordinary man working at home depot or home mart as it is in the movie he looks like just your every day man but can kill you with just about any everyday weapon and he does this so calmly that big crazy car scenes and explosions would rake away from his character a man that takes the bus to come kill a whole gang is pretty bad ass by any standard as always i dont want to give spoilers but i do recommend this as a good wholesome action movie,0.6602,1
"Mostly atmosphere, zero story",ToddWebb,5 October 2014,6,at the end of it all i found this movie very boring the story is old as dirt the plot is so obvious that as soon as characters appear on screen one can identify hell be killed shell be kidnapped and used as bait something bads gonna happen to him and my alltime favorite hes the innocent likable guy introduced early then ignored for minutes so well forget about him only to have him turn up as a hostage in the big showdown and every prediction is spoton example of bad writing two thugs walking up to a door the last thing thug says to thug as they approach the door whatever you do dont call him little john very next shot inside the door thug starts talking smack and guess what he does when the setup is literally seconds earlier we all see it coming give us the setup in a different location maybe or at least disguise the setup amidst a longer funnyentertaining conversation nope just lay out that one line setup then walk on in we the viewers will just deal with it denzels character is likable i mean insanely likable beyond the depth of my willful suspension of disbelief likable hes always friendly always in a good mood always smiling hes ecstatic just to be alive everyone loves being near him hes never just a guy hes more helpful than a college professor more inspirational than a priest more motivational that a fitness instructor every scene in his workplace which is visited repeatedly throughout the movie includes no less than background guys smiling giddily when denzel arrives to work and laughing loud at every word denzel speaks going to work at home depot sorry home mart surely isnt like that in real life but theres more to denzel isnt there who is this guy whered he come from who knows well never know but clearly hes badass more moves than shakira and deadlier than seal team six he seems to know how to handle any situation and any number of attackers just because no reason hes just awesome if you ever saw the classic comedy planet terror just think of the scene give him the gun give him all the guns because ya know hes just so badass for no logical reason the bad guy was awesome while denzels fight scenes were a lot of superclose blurry shots the few scenes where the bad guy establishes his badness were rather good very tense very violent and cringeworthy the equalizer has all latest bells and whistles with music atmosphere and buildup the one female lead is developed nicely especially compared to every other innocent victim who may as well have stepped out of little house on the prairie much of the movie is very tense and keeps you hanging on to each scene waiting to see what happens next but ultimately we all know denzel will kick ass so its all just a waiting game it felt very long the wait is made so much worse when the viewer knows exactly whats coming theres just no surprises here youve seen this movie times im sure oh yeah and denzel knows everything he appears magically inside buildings and rooms where one shouldnt be able to sneak in he has cell phone numbers one shouldnt have access to the characters even comment on it how the hell did you get that number no answer doesnt matter its a movie just turn off your brain and enjoy the tension building how does denzel know when the bad guys will appear at a time and place so he can intercept them in the night dont know doesnt matter i guess how does denzel sneak into a closetsized room without the occupant noticing how does denzel have time to set up his trap rig wires etc without anyone seeing this work being done who cares the resulting deaths are cool go to sleep tune out enjoy but dont expect to take this movie with you youll have forgotten it by the time you leave the parking lot,-0.9782,0
"If you love Denzel, and you loved Training Day, and your only wish was that that bad-ass could have been a good guy, then this is the movie for you!!!!!",missgriffin,10 September 2014,10,the equalizer is not man on fire the equalizer is not your typical action flick washingtons robert mccall is not selfdestructive or addicted though there are great choreographed fights special effects and fantastic explosions the equalizer is more bourne than bond denzel washington portrays this excia operative who is content to live a meticulously simple life quietly contained but with everbuilding intensity washington turns in another stellar performance chloe grace moretz as the teenage prostitute is a force antoine fuqua the directer who brought us training day which earned denzel his best actor oscar helms this movie with a steady hand his direction of the drama and the action blend seamlessly drawing us into the complexity of this characterdriven piece robert mccall keeps to himself content to live his ordinary life he is every mans man but his steady moral compass and strong sense of justice lead him back into the fray this character is not infallible and he is not looking for trouble he just wants whats right this film is a superbly acted exciting and violent ride in the pursuit of justice there will be blood but this time youll be rooting for the good guy and i a fifty years young woman loved every minute of it,0.9931,1

Really enjoyable movie,danielmanson,18 June 2022,8,for years now ive had people tell me i have to watch this and for whatever reason ive kept putting it off today i apologise because this is a fantastic film and i really enjoyed it what struck me straight away was that first mins or so im sold it tells us the characters you can see where its heading and it fished me in quickly from then on it was just an insane and tense ride what was great was that every scene had a purpose there was no messing about no filler scenes with no point everything meant something and thats a rarity in this day and age the suspense by the way wow had me on strings the entire time never knew which was it was heading i really enjoyed the characters as well denzel wasnt just this stereotypical action guy that went round shooting people there was so more more to him more complexity if you will and with that there was more to delve into you definitely get a john wick vibe to this movie and with the main character so if you like that youll like this just a quick mention i would have liked to have seen elenateri more i felt she had a lot of depth that could have been explored i think my only i guess negative was that the villains evilness wasnt explained or explained well not sure if i missed it but i didnt truly get why he was so evil but yeah overall i really enjoyed my time watching this and ill be jumping on the equaliser asap definitely recommend if you like an action a very strong from me today,0.9314,1
Colder Opportunities,billygoat1071,1 October 2014,6,the equalizer is loosely based on an television series with the same name this reinvention in comparison aims to be darker and much violent but the films ambition is basically turning its star denzel washington into a grittier action hero it somehow pays off when he starts killing bad guys in cold blood and its amazing how he could still carry the characters humanity along the way the film troubles when it gets out of hand to its glorious vigilantism despite it takes place in a world seems apart from that context if you tend to ignore the sentiments and shade of reality you can still tell that its a pretty entertaining piece of action but in general its just difficult to not notice its mess of tones even with that amount of fun there is one side in the film when its totally gripping that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime this grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence sometimes feeling like a doomed helpless world but once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of it doesnt actually sucks out its entertainment quality but it does betrays that intriguing context nearly turning itself into a superhero movie except of course its less silly and much violent mccall in shorthand is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger it may not be big deal to many viewers especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice the cool slowmos and stylish special effects might have also rob the sense of realistic tension but put that aside each action scene is watchable enough we dont usually see a wider blockbuster today that has the guts to fearlessly show brutal movie violence like this this is probably the only mundane element existing in those set pieces denzel washington shifts his character to two personalities one is the likable ordinary man himself and the antihero with a hidden cosmic hate through its world the performance does sum up the overall movie from gravitas to smugness and whats great is theyre both effective anyway however the villains and their tattoos have blatantly shown that theyre evil the main antagonist seems like hes written to be overthetop almost like a cartoon villain than a believable human mafioso but marton csokas gives a little grimness as he have fun with it the equalizer would have been nicer if it was a little shorter and much consistent but i could guarantee that it still entertains it does have the appeal through its action and acting though there are more serious things that could have made it a lot compelling thriller the film does have the knack of embracing either of its elements but it just keeps shifting back and forth like were not getting to the actual big picture well if you can accept that the hero is this superior then it might work better for the experience for now it can be endlessly watchable but you will only find few things that are remarkable about it,0.9923,1
"McCall...NOT McClane!! Dark, edgy violence, as well as fantastic performances separate this action movie from the pack!!",cap96,17 September 2014,10,some reviews have characterized this movie as your typical runofthemill action movie nothing you havent seen beforenothing could be farther from the truth this movie is based off the television series called the equalizer it is about an excia operative who uses his special skills to help ordinary people who have no other recourse this movie version of the equalizer is more reminiscent of matt damons jason bourne and it is this that sets this movie above your typical action flick in fact in mr damons own words the equalizer reminded me of the bourne identity in that both are sophisticated adult thriller franchises where the protagonists are capable of highaction exploits but arent running around in spandex directed by the great antoine fuqua the man who brought us training day the equalizer is a gritty and violent suspenseful and superb action film this movie is very characterdriven and denzel washington who plays protagonist robert mccall gives another stellar performance his character lives alone keeps to himself and seems to suffer from some form of ocd most importantly mccall is not mcclane he is not a wisecracking cop in the wrong place at the wrong time but rather a quiet and complex character whose sense of justice is awakened when a young girl is brutally beaten this movie gives you everything you would want from an action film guns explosions and great effects however the violence and bloodshed in this movie are deserving of its r rating and create this films authentic feel the excellent performances by the cast are also what raise this movie well above your ordinary action movie team washingtonfuqua gives us a darker hero for darker times and one you will cheer on every step of the way,0.9575,1
Welcome To The Black Rambo,TheAnimalMother,10 October 2014,6,fairly solid action scenes characters and overall execution somehow the filmmakers and actors make this very hard to believe film enjoyable this is definitely a sensationalistic filmthe most sensationalistic of washingtons career without a doubt and its mostly a regurgitated cookie cutter crowd pleaser of violent vengeance as well but it does manage to remain quite an entertaining action film at the same time even though it has a running time of over two hours the film does feel overall as though it is missing a few key scenes but nonetheless its still worth a look if youre into these kinds of films the movie didnt remind me much at all of the old tv series of the same name the film is much more reminiscent of some of the old brutally violent morality tales that charles broson use to do all that said this basically chalks up as a good film to watch when you dont want to think much and you just want to watch a lot of kick ass entertaining violence its that kind of guilty pleasure,-0.8322,0
Could have been great if it hadn't turned silly,mikegibb-60418,26 May 2020,5,the film starts so well interesting character played by washington a quiet man who goes to a coffee shop at am every night to read one of hundred books recommended by his wife before she died and there he meets a young prostitute who he tries to help when she gets beaten up then suddenly he turns into rambo and starts slaughtering all the bad guys in greater boston the last twenty minutes are just ridiculous he tackles and destroys a small army of baddies armed with sub machine guns using the contents of the diy superstore where he works he could picked up half a dozen of their weapons but no he tackles the ruthless leaders armed to the teeth with a nail gun and of course wins it was like watching an adult version of home alone and then obviously getting leave of absence from the home works depot he travels to moscow and kills a mass of russians what a waste of a good actor and an initially good plot idea,-0.4661,0
Effective and dynamic,FrenchEddieFelson,16 March 2019,None,in the inventory of almost normal heroes like jason bourne jack reacher frank castle bryan mills john wick here is a brand new one robert mccall aka the equalizer he gives a chance to the unlucky ones against the villains by equalizing the forces in this first opus he meets by chance a prostitute as young as lost and hop hop hop he annihilates the russian underworld of boston wooooow sounds easy the result is rather successful i loved it,0.9034,1
good start but fight in Home Depot disappoints,SnoopyStyle,6 March 2015,6,robert mccall denzel washington has a mysterious past and is trying to live the quiet life working at a boston home improvement box store he helps his coworker ralphie lose weight to get the security guard job hes friendly with street walker terialina chloë grace moretz whom he often meets as he reads at a local diner she ends up in the hospital after getting severely beaten up by her pimp slavi he tries to buy her freedom but ends up killing everybody violent russian gangsters come looking for payback this starts well even with the clichéfilled script denzel can pull it off chloe is the innocent and hes the knight in shining armor the problem starts when chloe disappears after the first act i expected her to be the second star and she deserves to be shes good in this movie but it is strictly a solo act the great brutal violence in slavis office is the highlight the action slowly turns more and more cartoonish director antoine fuqua has made some great gritty action i wish he brought a bit more training day unfortunately the last battle in the home mart reminds me too much of home alone there is something compelling about not showing what happened with the hammer thats a great scene its a little more silly to see all the improvised traps in the store,0.0712,1
Washington nails it,MediaPanther,26 September 2014,8,antoine fuquas big screen adaptation of the s tv series the equalizer opens with an impressive tracking shot through an open window and into the orderly and near empty apartment belonging to robert mccall denzel washington mccall lives a spartan existence for the first twenty minutes of the picture he hardly says a word fuqua training day gives a lengthy shot as you watch mccall fold something delicately into a napkin when you see him unfold the napkin at his regular diner and place the teabag into a cup of hot water you understand immediately that this man is a creature of habit firmly set in his ways every night hes there reading a book hes such a regular that he strikes up a familiar acquaintance in a young teenage prostitute teri chloe grace moretz which eventually grows into something of a friendship there is something undeniably hidden within him however when he realizes the danger teri is in thanks to her nefarious russian pimps he forgoes his cautious life and willingly brings on the pain director fuqua accordingly really brings on the style for these sequences his relative quiet touches give way to mayhem before every murder mccall commits the camera slows down taking on a golden hue and you literally see mccall breaking down every element of his victims tattoos facial expressions and then he lets loose even timing himself to see if he can voice dispatch mafiosi in seconds or less and the equalizer is undeniably fun its one of those thrillers that begins moody and atmospheric and then decides it would be more fun to see how many people can be dispatched with nail guns or corkscrew openers and it is similarly unconcerned with logic in the idea that mccall decides to take down the entire east coast hub of the russian mafia simply over one teenage prostitute but with fuqua this stylistically assured and washington equally game does it really matter as teri chloe grace moretz kick ass carrie forgoes the sarcastic strategy jodie foster used as a teenage hooker in scorseses taxi driver teri is arguably much more frightened of her violent handlers and is less given to false bravado as result and even though her character really amounts to little more than a glorified supporting part after she is sent away she is a great deal of fun to watch and she holds her own more than capably against denzel washington the book of eli the habit of extended cameos in the equalizer is even more extreme in the case of melissa leo as roberts former cia contact who pops up to give a vital piece of information on the evil mobster and to tentatively tiptoe around the subject of his wife while offering a small measure of comfort the bit part parade reaches blinkandyoumiss him cameo status by casting a reputable star like bill pullman as leos husband and giving him no more than four lines though of course its possible that this may be a larger part that met with cuts in the editing room if anything a weakness of the equalizer is that mccalls troubled personal life is left as somewhat ambiguous who can blame it really the opening aims for a quiet kind of profundity and it succeeds but isnt really interested in following through for all its thin characterization there is something just as nice in watching denzel washington coldly and calculatingly firing a nail gun in righteous vengeance see more at,-0.6646,0
Ridiculous superhero movie. And I loved it.,javier_8,17 June 2019,7,this movie has a generic plot damsel in distress the bad guys the overpowered superhero that can kill anyone in the most stylish and ridiculous ways but its entertaining like if you dont think about the plot too much and you just want to enjoy the good guy punish the bad guys and bring a small piece of justice to the world cool slowmotion scenes cool fight scenes ridículous but cool and denzel is great at this role fun ride,0.9653,1
Denzel Washington is dope,bbickley13-921-58664,26 September 2014,8,action drama humor denzel can due it all based on the tv show denzel washington is yet another old man similar to pierce bronson in the november man trying to prove hes still got it by playing a mysterious dude who works at a megamart who decides to help a young hooker who got beat up pretty badly and ends up taking down some major hitters in the russian mafia then becomes a target for the main boss the movie had a quiet tone similar to denzel and director antoine fuquas last flick training day but denzels performance in this is far more oscar worthy denzel still brings passion to movies in an age were other actors like him are phoning it in just for the pay check and basically thats what makes the movie watching denzel on screen in all fairness the equalizers main antagonist a man the mob sends to take care of their problems was no slouch either it was so entertaining watching these two hunt each other down possibly the worse part of the movie was there was not enough chloë grace moretz whose role in the movie is no more than a gloried cameo overall mr fuqua directed the great denzel in another amazing role,0.9716,1

Above average action flick saved by Denzel Washington's great performance,nscoby93,2 July 2022,7,what holds this film back the most is it doesnt really do much to separate from all the other action flicks of a man taking the law in his own hands the films plot isnt to bad its pretty simple and doesnt go anyway you wouldnt expect the action scenes are solid bloody gorey and enjoyable to watch but what i would usually critique as being slightly above average goes above average thanks to denzel washingtons great performance its no man on fire but its satisfactory nonetheless its a little to long considering the content of the film but it remains an enjoyable film not great but not terrible imdb letterboxd watched on bluray,0.9776,1
A Script Written By A 5-Year-Old Aspiring Hollywood Screenwriter,hopsinglinglao,31 October 2014,2,sorry denzel not even your amazing talent could save this laughably insultingly lame simpleminded patronizing movie straight from the mind of a toddler trapped in a year old hollywood screenwriter fantasizing about saving abused hookers from fat russian mobsters but good things about this movie denzel and mustache twirling bootleg kenneth branagh main villain and from this point on my review will simply be titled hollywood thinks hollywood thinks that russians speaking to each other randomly pepperin english for some odd reason then go back to their native language to say important info like yes hollywood thinks every man only gets mad about injustice when its a young attractive female who is being abused and beaten by rich fat ultra violent mustache twirling foreignerweirdos hollywood thinks excia members go around wiping out entire crime families not because they want to stop crime or injustice to the general public but because one white woman was abused by russian pimpmobsters who very obviously had done that type of thing to countless menwomen before but it is okay for the hero to murder people because hey they hit a woman they are onedimensional evildoers who dont deserve even a trial or gas chamber for their crimes they deserve a vigilante death hollywood thinks the russian mafia and the boston pd are both incompetent fools these rocket scientists run around saying things like no witnesses but brashly brandish guns in broad daylight and shoot at things all the time out in public while doing fauxmilitary hand gestures thought up by the year old screenwriter while playing contra and apparently half of the corrupt cops in this universe are making gobs of money with the ohsodangerous yet generic mafia groups while the other half is shaking down mexican jack blacks mom for pocket change at a taco stand because thats such a booming industry in the southy projects feed me to thah poor by dah way hollywood thinks an excia member can lecture mobsters about lying killing and insulting a government agency for corruptionas if they have such a squeaky clean record and they also think we the idiot simpleton audience is supposed to shake in our boots at these tired played out tropes revolving around the russians and cia and corrupt cops who talk like caricatures from an unreleased sopranos subplot hollywood thinks that every vigilante murder destruction of property torture etc can be written off as legitimate because said vigilante was an exciafbilaw enforcement officer with some current tie to an operational government contact in this case a female instead of a male because that is just so out of the box unexpected so progressive this film hollywood thinks they need to shoot everything in slow motion because matrix hollywood thinks people with guns often give vigilantes minutes of slow motion time to plan out killing them with random blunt or sharp objects just after adjusting skullshaped items to foreshadow their doom hollywood thinks the audience is stupid and they may have a point so constantly have characters yell out things like oh this is the ring i lost and oh my god you did it because we idiots could not done figure that out oh golly geez and a wippdee doo hollywood thinks by shooting people talking that are famous and telegraphing what is good and evil over and over again with the same idiotic tropes that it counts as great cinema fk hollywood and fk this movie,-0.9989,0
Great movie,0U,22 February 2020,None,really great action sequences with some nice violent ends and a very interesting story that almost feels like it starts in the middle leaving you guessing about his past it kind of has a very john wick feel to it but maybe slightly less overthetop crazy,0.3542,1
Slow Paced Action Movie,allstarrunner,19 September 2014,6,the acting in the movie was spoton beware if part of your reason for seeing this movie is because you are a fan of chloe grace moretz she is only in the film for what seems a total of minutes minutes at the beginning minutes at the end she has an important role and plays it well there just isnt much of her the pacing is slow and while the action is good there isnt as much action in this movie as you might think be prepared for that the bad guys are pretty inept that was my number one disappointment with the film for a one man army who is trying to take down one of the most powerful crime lords in the world it was way too easy to navigate through the bad guys there is nothing that evokes any type of emotional reaction during the film at least for me it was a pretty run of the mill dramaaction film if you like slower paced character driven stories where the bad guys dont put up much of a fight and you enjoy the good guy dismantling the enemy one by one then you will enjoy this film other people are comparing this somewhat to bourne dont expect bourne you will be disappointed,0.8783,1
"An action packed two hours, it's worth seeing.",Sleepin_Dragon,30 August 2023,8,robert mccall appears on the surface to be a mild mannered employee at a hardware store but underneath his cool and calm exterior he operates as a one man vigilante fighting to defend those who cant defend themselves ill admit i was one of those that ground when this was first announced as ive forever been a fan of the original tv series woodward made the role his own but i have to say i have always enjoyed watching this reimagining with the third installment now in the cinema it felt like the right time to dig this one out its an action packed well paced bloodthirsty two hour thrill ride denzel washington nails it as mccall it doesnt take long for him to establish as a character we learn a lot about him very quickly we know what he stands for i was keen to learn why he does what he does what motivates him i really did rate marton csokas as teddy he is the stereotypical cliché ridden villain but he really did rise to the occasion hes a bad guy you instantly dislike much better than the first it holds up well hard to believe it was released nine years ago and whilst it is pretty violent in parts the story is actually a very good one,0.9741,1
"DENZEL WASHINGTON IS FANTASTIC, PROBABLY MY FAVE DENZEL FILM.",lukem-52760,2 February 2020,7,i loved the equaliser i loved the legendary denzel in his role as the extremely skilled dangerous robert mccall an excia agent turned urban vigilante denzel is one of the greatest actors in cinema history fact i grew up watching loving this guy over the years hes cranked out some amazing films such as training day man on fire deja vu the taking of pelham the bone collector many many more films im a fan of denzel but some of his flicks i didnt like such as inside man the book of eli terrible ending guns but most of his work is usually excellent with excellent performances here denzel gives another incredible performance to his big list of great roles mccall is a deadly man but a good man who will stop help someone in trouble here set in boston he gets in deep trouble with the local scum the violent russian gangsters who pimp out young girls here mccall helps out a young brutalized girl teri played greatly by cloe grace moretz comes head to head with a very dangerous man called teddy played intensely by martin csokas we also have a small role for the excellent bill pullman who turns up later in the film director antoine fuqua has created a fantastic urban vigilante action thriller thats exciting gritty brutal fun the fact robert mccall works a regular ordinary job in a hardware store is just genius grounds everything is a sense of realism mccall goes about his violent business cleaning up a dark crime ridden boston meets good people as well as bad people some of my favourite moments are just of mccall sitting in the all night diner reading his book drinking his tea little scenes like that are just beautiful with the night time setting the look of the city streets at night are all captured beautifully the action is brutally fun when mccall starts using his special skills on the local thugs corrupted cops its a joy to watch him doing what we would all love to be done in real life another excellent denzel washington film role this is probably my favourite denzel film role,0.9945,1
"Entertaining, but....",michaeldomajnko,9 October 2014,6,let me guess denzel washington is the hero again taking down all of the russian mafia in his wake with some very predictable and no so original fight scenes i am not sure how many times i have seen denzel walking away with an explosion in the background and at times i felt like i was watching man on fire again and had to remind myself that this was not that film while this is not by far denzels best action film it is entertaining for the most part and i found the best scene not actually one of the fight scenes but the verbal confrontation of both he and teddy marton csokas i did get the feeling that this film was made in a hurry as it simply could have been made so much better in saying that it is worth watching so long as you remind yourself that it is just a movie,0.8696,1

No it's not a sequel to Man on Fire - though Denzel Washington IS dope,Drive-in_Zeppelin,6 October 2014,6,directed by antoine fuqua training day shooter the equalizer is a story of vigilante justice and badassery done right anywho washington plays the seemingly ordinary robert mccall who works at something like a home depot and is generally liked he helps his coworker get in shape for some physical he builds rapport with his customers and he makes small talk with a year old callgirl named teri played by chloë grace moretz wait what miss moretz plays a lady of the evening surely youre pulling my leg no dear reader shes being pushed around by those sneaky russian mobsters that occupy the noble city of boston so she has no choice carrying on teri also known as alina is one of the regulars at a local diner similar to something out of edward hoppers nighthawks that robert also frequents in his insomnia hes always reading books such as the old man and the sea and don quixote so they ultimately form an informal bond as she feels a peculiar trust and feeling of safety in his presence long story short robert finds out that the russians messed alina up pretty bad so he takes it upon himself to try and buy her freedom from the gangsters this is when the movie turns into the bourne films as denzel washington suddenly channels his inner assassin and kills the gangsters in the most methodical and efficient way possible because they turned down his petty cash having awoken the inner killer that he apparently was trying to hide robert mccall then proceeds to begin a series of vigilante acts to maintain his peaceful yet seemingly lonely lifestyle who is he to have all this advanced killing ability well youll just have to watch the movie meanwhile marton csokas is sent in as the archetypal russian hitman despite the actor being from new zealand to find out who killed the other russians turns out the gangsters mccall thought were just pimps were actually the local figureheads for a massive criminal syndicate go figure thats about all i can say for this film its extremely well polished and has decent performances all around despite being a bit part i do want to highlight chloë grace moretz as being an actress im extremely excited to watch in the future though it was a bit unsettling to see the young actress playing a prostitute initially i thought she was annoying as hitgirl in kickass but i think that was just her character i think shes an extremely talented actress and personally cannot wait to see what she delivers in the future additionally all the technical stuff in this film like setdesign cinematography action sequences this movie is basically the ideal standard for how all of those should work in a modern action flick anything less is just sloppy filmmaking in my opinion if this is the type of movie you want to make antoine fuqua delivers a solid film like he did with training day and shooter and thats all she wrote read this and other reviews on the driveinzeppelin website,0.9846,1

"Denzel Washington in ""The Toolbox Murders""",The_Film_Cricket,1 October 2014,None,in its introductory scenes the equalizer is not a bad movie however once the plot gets underway it becomes one here is yet another movie about a oneman arsenal hellbent on mopping the floor with grimy hoodlums who are turning the world into a cesspool of inhuman cruelty while wallowing in blood and gore youve seen this movie before an ordinary guy walks into a room full of guntoting thugs and in seconds of jump cuts dispatches everybody in the room and then struts out the door accompanied by a rock soundtrack clichés like this can be avoided i was impressed last week by the skill with which scott frank rethought the elements of this genre in a walk among the tombstones so it stands to reason that i had hope that antoine fuqua could have that kind of restraint with this movie after all this is his reteaming with denzel washington after directing him to a best actor oscar twelve years ago in training day he cant this is a routine bloodbath that steals elements from taxi driver walking tall taken dirty harry and every other managainstthemachine movie of the last years the equalizer is based very loosely on a cbs television series starring the late edward woodward that ran from to it was a good show featuring the adventures of a retired intelligence agentturnedprivate eye named robert mccall who specialized in helping out the little guy the movie has a little of that it has denzel washington as a guy who lives a fastidious lifestyle barren of all clutter who spends his days and nights in a course of routine he works in a home supply store by day and spends his evenings at his regular table at the corner coffee shop reading hemingway we dont know much about him but his obsessive compulsive nature fascinates us he notices things hes interested in those around him at work he takes pity on a coworker named ralphie johnny skourtis who is trying to lose weight to become a security guard at the restaurant he has friendly conversations with a young girl named teri chloë grace moretz whose choice of outfits leave no mystery about what she does for a living one night teri is picked up by her pimp and later ends up in the icu mccall follows up on her and finds out that the pimp is working for the russian mob what follows is the kind of movie that charles bronson use to make in his later years when he was just repeating the formula of death wish mccall singlehandedly sparks a oneman war against the russian mafia not satisfied to take out the guy who roughed up teri he has to rub out the entire foundation of the citys criminal elite over and over he walks into a room and wipes out every guy in the room with whatever happens to be available at the moment mainly power tools no points for guessing that his job at the home supply store will come back in the films action climax the movie is one long bore it starts off with some interest before it gets tedious then it gets frustrating then it gets boring then it gets repetitive then it becomes a parody of itself the villains all look the same the story repeats the same stuff over and over and denzels character is such a good fighter that there is no dramatic tension in the fight scenes by the time we see denzel walking in slowmo toward the camera while the building behind him blows up real good you get the feeling that the writer and the director just didnt care,-0.972,0
"Slow and clichéd, but with some fantastic action sequences.",Troy_Campbell,26 September 2014,6,reteaming years after their oscarwinning training day director antoine fuqua and star denzel washington deliver another guilty pleasure with this murky revenge flick washington plays robert mccall a man with a dark past trying to eke out a quiet life until he feels compelled to help a young prostitute chloe grace moretz truly horrible who is beaten to a pulp by her russian pimp trouble is this particular pimp is part of the russian mafias american contingent so a simple chat over coffee and cake wont do the trick so after an excruciatingly slow opening minutes washington is unleashed in a tense and ultimately bloody confrontation that results in the russian mob sending over more minions led by marton csokas sinister sociopath to be slaughtered in slow motion awesomeness if the plot sounds a bit clichéd hooker with a heart of gold evil ruskis one last job ridiculously inept and indispensable henchmen thats because it is fuqua attempts to imbue his film with dramatic heft yet he shouldnt have bothered when delving into character motives moral choices and grand thoughtprovoking themes the movie stutters and splutters thankfully the numerous action sequences are of an extremely high calibre the finale is especially epic with mauro fiores cinematography and harry gregsonwilliams score combining with fuquas flair behind the camera to dish out an appropriately hard core climax more of a rainysundayarvoonthecouch type of film but if youre a diehard denzel fan then youll likely appreciate this on the big screen,-0.4454,0

"Too long, too violent, no plot...",geobyr25,15 October 2014,6,ill start with the positives great acting overall denzel chloe and i really liked marton csokas who reminded me of a young kevin spacey the chemistry between denzel and marton was great and there were some really comic bits with denzel dancing handing out the money etc etc i like chloe moretz and she really has grown up and grown into her roles however i didnt like her in this role she didnt suit the character of russian abused prostitute she was very healthy looking if you know what i mean just because she wears a few different wigs doesnt make me care about her even after she got hospitalised i didnt care for the character as there as noooo development a flashback of how she got sent to america and wound up where she did would have been helpful but no we just see her at a cafe she swears and wears a pair of slutty shoes and bam we are expected to know who she is another thing that annoyed me was the complete lack of motive denzel didnt have a real reason to do anything he did in the whole film i understand he cared about this random prostitute whos name he learned minutes before defending her honor but to brutally and i mean brutally murder about people because she got beaten up i mean fair play beat up the guy who did it because shes about but going all the way to moscow to kill some guy who doesnt even know your name while hes showering didnt make sense to me once again the general lack of character development bothered me they tried to make denzel mysterious and it just seemed lazy and straight up boring who were the random couple he visited their names werent even mentioned and they served no purpose other than to give a bit of random recon on martons character that then went on to serve no purpose there was a glimpse of a revelation random woman divulged into denzel having previously faked his death or something along those lines but it was never discussed again and there was a mention of another wife that had died that he promised to never do what he does again for and if he loved this wife so much why would he go all nail gun sledgehammer mirror shard corkscrew crazy to brutally kill so many people to avenge some random girl getting beaten up surely the promise made to a dead wife is more important than some girl who isnt really your problem it was far too violent as an example liam neesons taken has just the right amount of violence you know the people he comes across are dead without having to show a zoomed shot of a corkscrew lodged into their throat or nail guns piercing flesh throats being slit open barbed wire ripping through someones neck a drill into someones spine it was like a saw movie i expected violence i enjoy horror films but it was just ridiculous the finale reminded me of home alone using all the home depot gadgets to beat the baddies when i saw him heating up the doorknob i laughed at how much it reminded me of the christmas hit and then the violence started and it got boring quick and then it went on for another minutes disappointed in you denzel,-0.9985,0

"Just an average action movie, but with Denzel Washington in it!",ithehappy,20 January 2015,6,well i more or less knew what was going to watch i mean a movie with action packed up and all but the main reason for me to watch the movie was well like a lot of other people denzel washington i mean hes a brilliant actor and just because of that i could watch this movie without getting annoyed i mean this is just an average action movie doesnt matter how many people say how many different things but thats just the simple truth you have seen this type before so many times sometimes with neeson in it some time with bruce willis etc but the difference was the villain in this movie mr csokas whom i find another brilliant actor as well but the problem is i believe his character is extremely underwhelmed regardless of some fancy show off fuqua tried to pull just like flight washington drives the movie and this movie means washington which is sad because we have seen how much great of a role a villain can play a lot of times some exclusive examples would be dark knight rises skyfall etc in latest times there is no denying that denzel was great as usual but as i said i expected a lot from csokas role too but i left extremely disappointed another negative of the movie is how it ended i mean i dont really remember an abrupt ending like this on a movie for a long time it just finished and in an awful fashion you cant stop the inevitable but really they could have at least made it a lot tastier just like someone was running out of time at the end of the day it was another propaganda type movie but i knew that it was very entertaining nevertheless with usual brilliance of washington and csokas too i mean to whatever extent he was given the chance to show off his you will certainly enjoy this like i did but if you wanted a complete package well you will miss it thanks for reading regards saurav,0.9911,1
"Great Movie, Great Acting. Better than the 80's TV series ""The Equaliser""",moonlightshadow393,29 March 2021,10,i dont intend to do a full review for this movie its already been done so many times by others its a great movie great acting better than the s tv series the equaliser about an exciaoperative who now has a caring nature living a quiet simple life reading books who goes on to using skills learnt in service for the good of others who are unable to defend themselves like many retired servicemen that have seen their fair share of violence they go on to become caring and compassionate hating injustice so robert mccall denzel washington becomes a true vigilante for the good who enjoys giving pain and suffering to those who truly deserve it so why so much hate for this truly memorable movie some reviewers say its too violent no it is not im almost years old an ex british servicemen and i dont like gratuitous violence yes there is some violence especially near the end but this is a movie its not a documentary its not meant to be truetolife it is though true entertainment so ignore all the haters and go see denzel washington who is as hard as nails whonailsit with a great performance a must see if you dont mind a little well deserved violence,0.5462,1
Home Depot Alone,siderite,30 December 2014,6,i guess this was exactly the kind of movie that it wanted to be retired nice guy with amazing violence skills gets upset and starts killing people to satisfy his own sense of justice and self importance few people remember the equalizer series from starring edward woodward and even fewer would recognize similarities with this film except the name my guess is that sony wanted this film to be a kind of pilot for a new tv series what really annoyed me off was that everything was completely blown out of proportion denzels character goes to help a girl what else and kills some russian mobster in the most ridiculous way possible but this was just an employee of a bigger mobster so he sends an uber psychopath to solve the problem and so this guy has to be killed hostages enter the fray captured in some home depot thingy they play minutes of counter strike inside only with household appliances and so on and so on they replaced woodwards brain with washingtons brawn and some ridiculous semblance of planning since he always wears a stopwatch and measures time for some reason that is never explained what can we learn from this film first of all that if you are an excia killer you can just assume there is no justice in the world but your own also the other people that could help like the police are just hired help for mobsters and if you are a helpless normal citizen that has to work hard for the slightest pay raise you will be beaten sold as a slave blackmailed when you make a little bit of money perhaps by corrupt cops and your only hope is some homicidal maniac who really enjoys killing people in creative ways after bullying them into taking the first shot he calls this giving them a chance bottom line a cliché from top to bottom this is like a history of violence on steroids and making little to no sense a feeler for a tv series that i hope will never be made it just offends just about everything involved in the plot the police the russian mobsters any military organization that is not the cia democracy the justice system in its entirety laptop makers that are not sony home depot ernest hemingway mexicans fat people just say its a completely average action movie and dont watch it,-0.929,0
Even better than I thought it would be!,seanraybuck,26 September 2014,9,most of the reviews on here seemed pretty favorable to this movie but there were only a handful of reviews out seeing that the movie hadnt been released yet and there were a couple of reviews that made me a little weary but my wifes favorite actor is denzel washington so i decided to take her to see it opening night to my surprise i found this to be one of my favorite movies of the characters do a great job drawing you into their world the russian gangsters are great and the main bad guy is awesome you know in an evil bad guy way of course denzel is incredibly engaging but even the other characters are well done and draw you into the world from the trailer it looks perhaps a little hoaky with the whole girl asking about the book he is reading and some of the dialogue from the trailer makes you think this movie will be cliché but i found that they did a good job developing the characters and those scenes if violence bothers you dont go see this movie but if you like a great engaging actiondrama movie and you want to see denzel whip up on the russian mafia go see this,0.9834,1
Entertaining But!,mselayan,26 September 2014,6,i watched the equalizer yesterday at the movie theater i think i had a good time watching this thriller with friends while munching on my nachos the events of the movie keep you excited and trying not to blink so you dont miss the imminent next kill washington was great as usual another movie to join his smart choices list aside from being a good theater watch experience a lot of the events did not make a lot of sense and i feel i have to point out that i just used euphemism here i find that the peculiar killing methods and dexterity were being excessively used as a tool to distract the spectator from the nonsensical part of the scene for instance the protagonist receives a threat call and is told to come to the home market and surrender before his coworkers are killed and the next thing you know is a place perfectly set up for slaughtering his opponents one after another wire systems hanging apparatuses and many other flawlessly prepared traps not to mention the part where the other men and their chief teddy who was unduly being referred to as the sharp and undeceivable psychopathic criminal were unable to determine where the drilling fight groans and broken glass noises are coming from this is one of the movies you would definitely recommend to any mindblowing actionthriller movies enthusiast on the other hand for diligent movie viewers or those who pay good attention to the plot and its technical aspects its just one of those movies on the shelf with a dont bother watch label,0.9208,1
"Long, Dumb and not so Fun",Fitzbob,20 September 2014,3,in while denzel washington was promoting his dumb but fun thriller out of time he gave an interview stating how it was nice to star in a film that didnt require him to do too much coming off the back of his oscar win for training day washington didnt exactly sugar coat the idea that out of time was a pay check gig pure and simple since then denzels film choices have seemed littered with these quick cash movies for every man on fire or inside man we get a safe house or last years forgettable guns the equalizer sees washington reteam for the first time since with training day director antoine fuqua audiences hoping to see a return to form from the training day duo maybe disappointed the equalizer feels like another pay check gig it certainly is dumb it lacks any of the fun of out of timeand that movie stared dean cain the equalizer is a remake in name only of the s television series of the same name the show starred edward woodard as a retired government agent turned private detective he spends each episode helping people similar to the ateam or highway to heaven it was never a show i was practically aware of but it seemed to be stable television for my parents growing up the version sees washington play robert mccall a mysterious quiet man who gets sucked back into his old violent ways while trying to help out a number of people in his life these people include a young prostitute played by chloe grace moretz she is under the control of the russian mafia who doesnt take to kindly to their business being interrupted if the plot synopsis sounds familiar its because its the basic premise for most steven segal movies or any action movie in the s dont get me wrong the equalizer is far better than any half past dead or exit wounds maybe not under siege but it is the first sign that this long awaited big screen equalizer lacks any sort of originality antoine fuqua with the exception of training day has never really dazzled on the big screen films like shooter and tears of the sun look the part but never really excite as action films the equalizer is no different long when it should be tight and loud when it should be quiet the equalizer is a bit like a spinning plate it starts off straight before quickly wobbling then completely crashing to the ground fuqua and writer richard wenk should take the full brunt of this the script feels like it should have undergone another rewrite you can feel every minute of the films min running time in an effort to include elements of the show denzel finds himself helping multiple characters during the movies act great for them but this puts the main plot on hold killing all momentum at one stage washington leaves the film altogether to meet with old work friends sorely underused melissa leo and bill pullman for a scene that does not add to the story in any way elements are brought up but never go anywhere it is eluded that his character has ocd but this is never established and appears and reappears at random all this makes the film disjointed and adds to the already bloated running time at this point you could forgive all this because it is an action film and you paid to see denzel kick ass and take names unfortunately fuqua drops the ball in this department also an initial confrontation with russian heavies is well shot for maxim tension but quickly unravels once the action starts the film feels like its edited in an attempt to cut around some of the violence and this makes the fight scenes seem clunky it doesnt help that it is so poorly let a similar compliant that was leveled against fuqua last film olympus has fallen denzel is always a watchable presence no matter what he is in and here it is no different unfortunately the screen play doesnt give him much of a character to work with the story goes out of its way to keep his character a mystery we learn next to nothing about him which makes it difficult to root for him he just comes across as bored or uninterested he does get some moments to shine and he is a warm presence in the his scenes with chloe grace moretz moretz here is excellent in the role bringing a real vulnerability as a young russian call girl and the late night conversations they share about books although very on the nose are engaging she brings a real heart to the film which is sadly lost when she is sidelined for the bulk of the running time without her washingtons character has no one to bounce off he just becomes a bore it would be easy to compare this film to tony scotts excellent man on fire and the marketing has gone to some length to draw a similarity between the two man on fire succeeded because tony scott was wise enough to spend an hour of the running time building a relationship between the two leads denzels anger and revenge seems justified in the equalizer it feels like fuqua skips through this stuff to get to the money shots its interesting that both films contain a shot of the lead character walking away from an explosion in man on fire its a moment which signifies the storm that is to come and the level of violence he is willing to go to in the equalizer its a hollow eye rolling moment thrown in just because it looks cool it kind of sums up the whole film d,0.948,1
Ink on Skin,tedg,2 February 2015,None,standard fare good guy is endowed with superhuman killing capability presumably used in the past for what the agency thought was good in simple retirement he is drawn by his sheer goodness into massive efficient elimination of the bad guys there isnt much else to this whats interesting here are three stereotypes that have enough currency that nothing has to be explained despite what we know of decades of incompetence if someone is hinted at having field experience we assume he or she is essentially invincible is this just from james bond is it a tacit pride in having our guys be badasses do some american viewers feel empowered by this what we know of the russians is that their gangsters are distributed in small groups and that oligarchs arent involved they make their money by stategranted monopolies and the graft while prevalent is notably nonviolent yet the mere mention or russian gangsters with profoundly loyal minions why is enough to assure us that they are worse than any other organized violent group we have tattoos now this is fascinating most of what we know of the russians is that they are heavily tattooed years ago tattoos and motorcycle gangs were conflated and in films we knew the japanese gangsters by their tattoos but today every kid with has tattoos and many of them try to project toughness is it just that these bad guys have thicker lines and cover more skin here all we have to see is a holdup man with tattoos and a skull keychain and we know all we need to,-0.296,0
Fun but indecisive and predictable,reppep,23 January 2015,6,this is clearly supposed to be a hardedged realistic film but it doesnt work without mccall being superpowered in some way and ocd is not time dilation i kept thinking of the tagline from the taken movies i have a very specific set of skills if cia agents were like this we wouldnt need the us army the plot is predictable i thought mccall had a completely unexplained noguns policy despite the tv characters highly visible pistol because he keeps ignoring guns in favor of cutting up his own hands but at the end he shoots a whole bunch of people and why do the bad guys fire silenced assault rifles without a target,-0.8934,0

A one time watch!!!,yashrajs536,2 February 2015,6,i had recently watched the equalizer and i liked its story acting and i also liked a action bar sequence by watching that sequence i had felt that the movie has got incredible action but as the movie was going i had felt that it has been more concentrated on a story line rather than showing some action and as the story was normal they had stretched the movie too much which i had not liked the movie had felt me like i watched it times helping others and all i am too much disappointed by this movie but as i liked it for its quite action sequences especially bar sequence and also for its bomb blasting sequences but the movie was not great not only in story but also in action in comparison john wick was awesome than this it had also got a simple story but its action sequences led me to like that movie but in case of equalizer there is nothing i can like except some scenes not the whole movie i am saying dont waste your money on this a one time watch believe me,0.9552,1
The good lone wolf,jorisboodts,9 September 2022,8,denzel washington crawls in het skin of a retired military specialist robert mccall because he promised his wife his violent days where over he took a job in a supermarket and lives a quiet life helping people get up in life and helping them in general the one thing he still enjoys doing when he gets to know a young prostitute who is being used by the russian maffia he wants to help her also or does the girl help him becoming his true self when she is brutally injured by a customer he wants to set her free by buying her out with the maffia when they refuse to do that and promise to use her until she is probably dead his sense of righteousness takes over and the true killer awakens in himself because the mob sends their specialist he has to go to the extreme to protect the people he cares about they dont yet know what they are up against the film is a good action film with a high good guy content but it has also many cruel scenes int it eventually it makes you wonder if there is such a guy among us like mr mccall,0.5346,1
"A good, entertaining film.",paddyryce,29 July 2019,7,the equalizer provides a very entertaing story along with interesting characters to which i wanted to learn more about,0.4019,1
The good old values,arahimihajiabadi,6 March 2022,9,a great thriller about a retired killer going after the bad guys and killing them all while saving innocents im sentimental like that i like the good guys to win and the bad guys to die painful deaths the calmness of denzel washington is just the right style for his character in the movie the eyes action scenes are pretty goodalthough not john wick level and the story seems well put together by the way who cares if it isnt anything like the old serieswho i as a year old havent even heard of this film is supposed to based on its a good movie on its own doesnt need to be related to anything else,0.8885,1
"Washington vs Russians, 2014 edition",Semisonic,13 December 2014,6,its hard to invent anything new in the genre of the action movies the equalizer is no exception this time we have denzel washington as a nice and hardworking employee of a big hardware store who comes to a nearby diner at nights to read but when a young slavic hooker named alina who he occasionally talks to gets into trouble this old man dedushka as the russian mobsters call him decides to put some peoplekilling skills he tries so hard to forget about to work the movies where a small and quiet man is revealed to be some sort of retired john rambo who gets back to business for the sake of justice are always a guilty pleasure you can predict almost all the plot turns and its not like it turns all that much but still you end up rooting for the good guy simply because all of us sometimes wish that such people really existed in this world the whole idea of a onemanarmy doing the impossible so that the weak and exploited of this world could finally have some peace in their lives will never die as long as we live in a society ridden with criminals and ruled by corruption too bad that a likable protagonist doesnt automatically make a movie excellent and that is why the filmmakers use all the tricks up their sleeves to persuade us to turn off the brain and judge by emotions only cruel and dumb mobsters poor young girls who need protection ruthless boss villains who seem to have no single positive trait about them and all that is financed with the russian oil awesome sauce i do admit with the way my country behaves lately in terms of the international matters the return of the oldschool image of a russian evil is very well timed and i personally have nothing against it after all we do deserve to be treated as a threat i just wish it was done in a fresher way denzel washington is without a doubt a great action movie actor but it looks like hell hardly top what he did almost a decade ago in training day now that was really intense there he really had to break a sweat to get the job done on the other hand in the equalizer things simply happen the way he needs so this action thriller inevitably loses the thrills it tried to hold and while the villain guy was moderately believable as a worthy opponent and the final scene in the hardware store was really impressive those were probably the only things in which this movie actually tries to stand out on the other hand with a little imagination this average action movie may turn into a very dead on political satire evil russians are exploiting and brutalizing a girl with a rather ukrainian name alina and a black man with a profile resembling barack obamas and a last name washington that speaks for itself manages to singlehandedly deal with all the bad guys and tops it with killing the mob kingpin whose last name starts with pu and ends with in in his moscow mansion since we all know that the real mobsters prefer london to moscow it makes the allusion even clearer and the fact that the movie was obviously filmed before the recent political turmoil makes it almost prophetic but even if that interpretation is just a pipe dream this movie is not that bad especially since for an eye candy it has chloegrace moretz whos obviously trying to do more various roles but still cant help ending up in the same cute a little clumsy and somewhat childish image not that we dont love her for that do we the bottom line is if you want to see a decent action movie where the good guys win and the bad guys die or if you like to find the hidden meaning where there probably is none then the equalizers your game but dont expect anything close to training day from it this way youll save yourself from unnecessarily high expectations and disappointment that usually follows,-0.9945,0
SOMETIMES WE MAKE THE WRONG CHOICES TO GET TO THE RIGHT PLACES,nogodnomasters,12 June 2019,10,bob denzel washington works at the boston home mart home depot he lives a very simple neat and orderly life he also acts as a life coach to those around him particularly an overweight coworker ralphie johnny skourtis who wants to be a security guard and teri a russian immigrant prostitute chloë grace moretz who he bumps into at a restaurant bob gives out advice like you got to be who you are and doubt kills his advice to the prostitute that she could be anything she wanted didnt work out when she thought she could be a boxer with her russian pimp sometimes people need more than a life coach they need a vigilante who happens to be one of the pips armed with a trained eye honey clover and a cork screw bob takes on the entire russian mafia which contains nothing but heavily armed stereotypical sociopaths with satanic tattoos there must be nearly a new vigilante films out there right now i know i reviewed most of them if i was going to watch one this one would be it parental guide fbomb no sex or nudity,-0.34,0
Toe to Toe With the Russkies!,rmax304823,3 September 2016,6,ive been trying to figure out the difference between action heroes like denzel washington here or matt damon in the bourne franchise and superman i mean clark kents superman its not always easy theyre always mild mannered until their latent identity is triggered none of them ever seems to lose a battle or be seriously wounded and they may not have xray vision but here the camera takes us inside washingtons eyeball and quick cuts show us the details of his surroundings that hes noticing washington is another lightningfast killer with a hidden identity just trying to get along in a huge home depot warehouse but these damned russian pimps and mobsters keep getting in his way clobbering his friends investigating him and generally making nuisances of themselves and man are they ugly hawknosed covered in inscrutable tattoos and with complexions like a relief map of afghanistan always sneering washington begins to push back wiping out six alert armed men in twenty seconds as if hed choreographed the dance the russians in turn call in their expert hit man marton csokas who may be the best performer in the movie in that hes able to segue between his two expressions a smile and a sneer he kills and maims brutally no matter that hes the best there is washington kills him too blows up some of the russian mafias oil tankers because well just because and then tracks down the capo de tutti capi in moscow and eliminates him end of russian mobsters in america and freedom for all the young girls theyve been running americans can breathe free again if you like the bourne franchise youll like this move because its a close imitation i thought that for what it was it was almost ruined by directorial excess the camera doesnt wobble too much thank god but fuqua seems intent on calling attention to himself as director some of the shots are plain pointless if washington prepares a cup of tea we must follow the teabag and watch it dip into the steaming water if a kitchen faucet is leaking slightly the camera is position in the basin of the sink looking upward at the spout as a drop of water forms and drips down the explosive fireballs are in slow motion because they cost a lot of money it could have been better the opening scenes in a kind of new york nighthawks cafe are engaging but we dont have to wait long before clark kent sheds his drab civilian clothes and emerges in all his majesty to kill the bad guys,0.8525,1
Tired old generic formula,Bohemian81,12 December 2014,4,yet again a movie about a lone american man that saves the day and kills all the foreign bad guys omg hollywood this again who writes this crap seen it a million times before back in the day it was still cool but now just shameless cliché after cliché no humor virtually no story illogical plot holes action is somewhat enjoyable to my shame i must admit i enjoyed some of the mindless action scenes but the biggest problem is that it is all to far fetched without any realistic basis it just looks stupid denzel isnt helping either dont get me wrong i like denzel and credits to him for trying but his over acting feels out of place he is just trying to hard and way to serious in a movie you cant take serious,-0.9107,0
Predictable but watchable,Wizard-8,10 June 2015,None,i am not sure why the makers of this movie bothered to get the rights to do a movie version of a television series when the movie has very little of the elements that were found in the television series i guess the most plausible reason would be that being an official movie adaptation of a television series the movie would have instant branding and make it easier to market than a movie with a more original plot line and characters anyway the story and characters in this movie are for the most part nothing you havent seen before either on television or in other movies youll be pretty much able to predict what happens before it actually does on the other hand these predictable elements are put forward in a professional manner washington does well playing someone with a dark past who is still good at his game the action scenes are brutal and fairly exciting and the movie as a whole looks very nice so im giving this movie a cautionary recommendation if you are looking for something new look elsewhere but if you dont mind seeing the same plot and characters all over again youll find this movie a well crafted retread,0.8945,1
A film with many faults but having Denzel as the lead saved it from failure.,MUFCOK,3 March 2015,6,denzel washington is one of my favourite actors of all time if hes in a film that will one of the deciding factors to whether i go and see it or not i think the equalizer was made with this in mind it is far from great it feels lazy and lacks any real depth but they know that a film with denzel as the lead will draw in the audiences the script pacing storyline character development all let this movie down in my opinion and when you add all of those to clichéd predictable scenarios it really doesnt make for a very good movie the story is so over done that there is no way it can offer the viewer any surprises we have seen this so many times before from the plot to the characters to the scenarios it all feels very repetitive denzel gives a good solid performance but he is hindered by the awful basic mind numbing script he really wasnt given much to work with and the scenes where he was given large amounts of dialogue it just felt clichéd and predictable i think it was trying to be one of those thinly plotted action movies where you can switch your brain off and enjoy it for what it is i think it does a good job at being this apart from one major fault the pacing the poor script and lack of depth to the plot make it drag somewhat it is simply too long for what it is with a run time of over hours it really drags in the middle the first minutes are good and intriguing and the final minutes offer good action and some good scenes the middle minutes simply doesnt have enough about it to keep your attention the equalizer isnt without its positives though denzel washington shows us another great convincing performance he really is a joy to watch he plays a very likable character with ease you always feel like you can connect with him as an actor that is probably one of his greatest traits the film looks brilliant the settings are all faultless and expose a real gritty atmosphere some of the scenes are very well done the scenes at the start and the end scene in particular are well made and tense the cinematography was given a lot of attention the action scenes are very immersing different approaches are used with slow motion shots and great music overall the equalizer has plenty of issues but also has many things which i like it is easy watching but that is about all it isnt going to be remembered as a classic and it certainly isnt one of denzel washingtons better films but it is entertaining enough just dont expect too much,0.9978,1
Epic Action Film!,vengeance20,21 February 2022,9,saw this in cinemas back in loved it have since got the film on dvd find it to be a pretty rewatchable film the film sees robert mccall a widowed man with a mysterious past in taking care of business by delivering hardcore brutal justice to those who deserve it it is then that robert comes across a criminal hellbent on taking him down in a world of crime violence i found the film to be pretty epic from start to finish its impressive never lets up from the start the story the scenarios action are impressive seeing robert do what he does best is great the characters are pretty well done relatable to life the pacing is pretty good along with the hour minute runtime overall its an epic action film you wont be disappointing once you watch youll enjoy every minute of it,0.9831,1
Passable action gimmick that could have been something more.,Samiam3,29 May 2017,6,the first few scenes of the equalizer suggest that it is going to be an intelligent movie and then it turns into a gimmickdenzel washington the untouchable action hero there are individual scenes in the movie that are quite rousing and filmed with flair and panache its easy enough to argue that the equalizer is a perfectly good action movie but for the intelligent viewer it is too hard to get completely emerged in because there are too many distractions the script has a disjointed feel to it and it leaves its hero under underdeveloped its always nice to see washington as a top tier bad ass who is as untouchable as the younger steven seagal but after fter one action scene you get the feeling that this movie is going to allow him to come away from every fight without even a scratch or a moment of hesitation and then comes the ultimate action gimmick of all a scene concludes with him walking away in slow motion from an explosion the climax of the movie involves a one against ten face off in hardware megastore here we start to border on satire as washington disposes of his enemies one at a time using the merchandise these images will put a smile on your face but they go on too long the equalizer like taken is an action movie that doesnt rise above the sum of its parts and leaves you a little dumbfounded about how seriously to take it there are dramatic undercurrents in they story that would have elevated the movie if director antoine fuqua has not chosen to abandon them,0.9135,1
Denzel is at the top of His Game,bryanjamesneumann,1 October 2014,10,the equalizer was and is the best movie i think of the fall denzel is at the top of his game his performance was awesome as robert mcall his poise and character were so cool he was an awesome character to see and portray the action scenes where off the chart especially the scene in the russian restaurant this is one of my favorite denzel movies of all time this is one i will for sure be owning when it comes out antione was awesome as director this is the first time that they have been together again since training day powerful movie go see it the bad guys are really bad in this movie and they do what they can but look out when they cross mcall they have no idea who they are messing with,0.8358,1
An 'almost' good movie,MetalHead21,10 February 2015,6,the advertisement showed denzel washington starring and that was the main reason i wanted to watch the film and i did denzel didnt disappoint as expected but the story did at times i felt he didnt really need to get involved in the story at allit was very impersonal the violence is good and stylish and deserves credit but the action was without pointthe hero seemed to be fighting without a cause as if fighting for the benefit of the human kind for its own sake and because of that the movie seemed to keep dragging on i found myself checking the time and wishing for the endit could have been and should have been done better i rate it out of mainly because of denzel and the stylized action,0.4325,1
Denzel + Revenge Movie = Awesome,fasteddie517,20 July 2021,10,great villains teddy slavi and pushkin great reluctant hero in denzel csokas as teddy is pure evil and i love it nice touch with melissa leo and his backstory the violence is justified the fights and mayhem are authentic and believable i have zero complaints and ive watched in in whole or in part at least times,0.296,1
Not terrible but not all that great either,Seth_Rogue_One,7 February 2015,6,a little disappointed by this one denzel doesnt even seem to try in this one to make anything ordinary of his character and hes one of my favorite favorite actors but he appears like he only did this one for the money and i expected chloe moretz to have a bigger role shes only got about minutes of screen time or less and the movie is too long and doesnt seem to know what direction its going a lot of times based on a tvseries and it shows it often feels like a big budget tv series pilot its not complete crap but weve seen it all before and a lot better i loved fuquas directing and washingtons acting in training day so its surprising that its not better than this,0.9808,1
"Heart, great acting, no shaky cam!",AlBroMedia,30 October 2021,8,ive been aware of this movie since its release in ive even seen clips of it on youtube every now and then but i finally decided to take the time and watch it in full and man was it worth it denzel is one of the greatest actors on the planet and im not sure this movie would have worked without him this movie did have a lot going for it though great lead and supporting characters good score and cinematography great fight scenes it doesnt hold back at the same time its not gratuitous and the story although has a simple plot did more world building than i thought i enjoyed my time in this scary corrupt version of boston if you enjoy the show the wire and would enjoy a toned down less hyper version of the john wick franchise this movie is clean and handles the story intelligently denzel kills every line and steals every scene my one gripe is the pacing kind of jumps around at the end of the second act before the climax but they had to get to the ending somehow enjoy the show it deserves the ratings it has maybe even better,0.9904,1
Decent but formulaic action,TdSmth5,18 January 2015,7,washington plays mccall a guy who works at a home improvement store at night he goes to a diner and ritualistically drinks tea while reading a book also at the diner every night is a young russian prostitute who waits there to be picked up by her rich clients they occasionally chat about the books hes reading his wife started a project to read a list of books but she died before she could complete it now hes repeating the project one night the girl is bruised they walk together and her pimp shows up and slaps her around some more another night the girl doesnt show up at the diner mccall finds out she got a beating and is hospitalized he goes to the hospital and talks to one of the girls colleagues who tells him how the girls are treated and that they are risking their lives mccall decides to visit the pimp and after a whole lot of nothing finally explodes and kills all the mobsters there pretty much singlehandedly that is often with just one hand that gets the attention of the main russian mobster who sends a cleaner named teddy to take care of things teddy is wellmannered welldressed softspoken but vicious after much investigation he finds out that mccall was behind the killings and starts tracking him and even pays him a visit mccall still living his slow life thinks about things he visits a woman whos some higher up in government she tells him its ok if he does what he has to do now mccall decides to act he goes after corrupt cops on the mobsters payroll destroys their entire operation and meets terry leading to the eventual final confrontation in the dark and with water sprinklers on of course when teddy decides to take mccallss coworkers hostage im not familiar with the tv series but this movie is a fairly average and formulaic action movie you have the reluctant hero with near superpowers who is forced to make justice when put in a corner personally i dont think washington makes that convincing of an action hero hes empathetic enough so i see him taking on the standard morgan freeman role at some point the story is very good though even though things go pretty much as expected the movie is about minutes too long for a movie that focuses so much on its lead we learn next to nothing about mccall and as much as this director and others do their best to glorify washingtonone just has to count the number of slowmotion shots of washingtonits marton csokas who steals the show as the calm and brutal teddy the movie also ends on a laughable and improbable situation as mccall travels to moscow but im in favor of movies who advocate the reading of books so ill give it one more point for that,0.9572,1
Watchable!,tgioinm,22 February 2018,3,another proof that there is no messing with americans if you mess with them you will get yourself killed all they need is a cork puller a nail gun and a book and youre in trouble first half of the movie was awesome and so promising the rest is just crap,-0.8319,0
"Lengthy, Boring ""Old Ex-CIA agent"" vs. Gangs movie.",Dr_Sagan,13 December 2014,None,this is a movie in the fashion of liam neeson kevin costner pierce brosnan etc recent movies where a retired ex cia agent with skills confronts and beats the hell out of some foreign criminals the main problem with the equalizer is its length and rhythm it lasts hours and minutes and there isnt much happening in this movie to justify such a long duration compared to taken the action is minimal denzel washington looks ok at his but his presence and some pseudokaratespy moves arent enough to fill the screen the rhythm of the movie is terrible from the beginning you expect to see the obvious to come action scenes butit is taking too long and the scenes are forced and pretentious the direction is poor the cinematography unnecessary dark and the use of some superslowmotion scenes near the end ridiculous and without the impact that the creators went for there are tons of clichés like guy vs rambolike improvised traps lots of who are you from bad guys who are about to die and the infamous cool guys dont look at explosions scene chloë grace moretz is really good as the troubled russian prostitute but her part is considerably small it should be a lot better but the creators were afraid to take any real chances overall dont be fooled by the starstatus of denzel washington this is a poor movie full of clichés that it would bore you by its length and poor execution,-0.9783,0
Good film but unnecessarily violent,bob-the-movie-man,2 October 2014,7,is it ever right for a regular citizen with the appropriate skills to go vigilante and stand up to wrongdoing and a corrupt justice system in the tv show of the s the equalizer edward woodward would in many ways the new film version of the equalizer is a story of a superhero but instead of the cape and the glory of the front page of the daily planet this hero melts off anonymously into the boston suburbs until it is appropriate to act again it is a more sinister sort of superhero denzel washington plays bob or robert when hes reading a mildmannered worker in a boston doityourself megastore but a man with a secretive past needing only it seems about hours sleep a night bob frequents an allnight diner where he befriends prostitute teri played by chloe grace moretz she ends up in the hospital thanks to some pimp heavies and bob exacts bloody justice on the guys unfortunately these are the henchmen of a huge russian mafia operation in the us and bobs fight becomes a fullscale war against the leader pushkin vladamir kulich and his badguyinchief the curiously named teddy played with menacing glee by marton csokas celeborn in lord of the rings but seen most recently in sin city this movie is a cut above the normal mafia crime drama story washingtons bob is portrayed as an intelligent thoughtful but deeply wounded man and the audience can empathise with his burning desire to give back to society and for people in general to just as woody in toy story would say play nice chloe grace moretz is again outstanding as the equally wounded teri trying desperately to find a way out of the deep pit she finds her life to be in moretz looks set to continue her trajectory to become a hollywood great and csokas as the steely and cold mafia killing machine makes for an extremely menacing villain also excellent in extended cameos are melissa leo are you still and effective team from oblivion and bill pullman independance day sleepless in seattle production values are high with some glorious cinematography mauro fiore avatar training day of the everphotogenic boston and the mood lighting david lazanchris culliton of the night scenes and the diner is top rate after a necessarily slow start to build character and back story the screenplay by richard wenk fair zips along and this longish running time of minutes speeds by relatively unnoticed by the bladder in particular the final climatic showdown between the main characters is suitably dramatic and set in a novel location for such a scene full of potential for home alone style activity in fact as my son pointed out there is another presumably unintended nod at the end of the film to the wet bandits closure to home alone also however what lets the film down for me is the gratuitous violence graphically shoved in the viewers face and in one case twice via flashback the director antoine fuqua training day should learn that less is more in such scenes and the imagination is a much more powerful tool hitchcock achieved as much by what he didnt show as what he did the film actually works best in its middle reel where some of the acts of vengeance are not shown at all washington calmly wiping down a lump hammer and putting it back on the store shelves i am also truly staggered that this film was released with a uk certificate the british board of film censors bbfc seem to have become desensitised to this as an issue perhaps they are just reflecting that society itself with youtube depictions of gruesome murders and beheadings has become desensitised to such scenes whilst i appreciate not everyone would share this view i have no problem with sex on the screen or swearing which most kids will hear and worse every day in the playground but this level of uncut violence in my view should automatically be given an certificate if a director wants a lower certificate then let them trim the shots the certificate should be a guidance as to what society things is acceptable for different age groups to see and for me the bbfc keep getting this wrong with respect to the violence part of their remit with inconsistent ratings they give the cartoonish violence of sin city an but the jokers pencil scene in the dark knight a really with graphic scenes involving a corkscrew and a power drill in this film and in an increasingly violent world i would personally not want my year old kid seeing this stuff vigilante films have always tended to stir up controversy no more so than when michael winners death wish came out in which created quite a storm particularly in the us again it is perhaps a sign of our desensitisation that there hasnt been more controversy over this film in summary this is a good and entertaining film that i would have given eight stars to with a recommendation to see but im knocking a star off for the unnecessarily graphic violence if gory violence is not your bag then this is one you should best avoid if you enjoyed this review please check out my other reviews on bobthemoviemancom and sign up to follow the fad thanks,0.9689,1

"Good, But More of the Same",3xHCCH,6 October 2014,6,this film is based so loosely from the tv series starring edward woodward as robert mccall an exagent who helped poor individuals who have no one else to turn to in their crimerelated problems but the mccall denzel washington is here no dapper english gentleman but he is a genial quiet employee of a home depottype warehouse store who kept pretty much to himself one day he meets and befriends a teenage prostitute alina chloe grace moretz at his usual dining place when she had been beaten up by the russian mobsters who handled her mccall gets shaken out of his neat little routines and an unparalleled killer of immeasurable means gets unleashed to champion the cause of the helpless masses this is another ofttold tale in hollywood these days an excia agent with superhuman abilities saving the day for some damsel in distress this year alone we have seen it in a walk among the gravestones with liam neeson and november man with pierce brosnan with the equalizer though we are given denzel washington in the lead role by the same man who directed him to his best actor oscar antonio fuqua the action sequences are wellplanned and orchestrated but i cant really say they are all that original they are of extraordinary violence and gore id give them that hence the local r rating the whole seeing small details around him while planning an attack routine has been done before and with much more logic in the sherlock holmes films the whole climactic walking away from a series of big fiery explosions behind the hero gimmick is practically a staple in countless a b or c level action films before this one the best scene in the whole film was probably the one where mccall talks facetoface with the vicious russian gang leader teddy marton csokas that scene was one big mind game where mccall exposes the weaknesses of his enemy using mere words that was an exciting psy battle of wits at its best better than all the shootouts and explosions in the film for me denzel washington did not look like he had the right physical look to realistically convince me that he could do the stunts mccall was doing however in these intense facetoface confrontation scenes you know he is the type who could psych you out crazy even with his penetrating stare alone this is what gives the equalizer an edge over all the other runofthemill action thrillers with the same basic story,-0.6922,0
"""When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.""",classicsoncall,18 May 2024,8,one could almost give this picture a top rating of if it wasnt for the outlandish idea that a single guy could take out the entire russian mafia operating in boston and for an encore head over to moscow to take out the boss not that im complaining i thought denzel washington gave an exciting if low key performance as the vigilante with a mysterious past erased by a faked death i liked the way bob mccall washington kept everything understated in his dialog with people like ralphie johnny skourtis hooker terialina chloë grace moretz and even the bad guys starting with slavi david meunier dirty cop frank masters david harbour and especially fixer extraordinaire teddy marton csokas as soon as mccall locked the door to slavis headquarters office you knew that this guy would take no prisoners and the rest of the film would be an action movie fans best idea of fun nowhere does denzel disappoint though i did like the idea that ralphie got the first shot in on teddy before mccall finished him off if he were still alive i bet teddy would have regretted calling mccall dedushka,0.7935,1
Silent but deadly,mappman728,23 October 2014,6,some films are a triumph of style over content this isnt exactly a triumph but antoine fuqua directs with a panache that the ludicrous plot and risible dialogue dont merit theres a highly enjoyable showdown in the us equivalent of homebase with nail guns electric drills strimmers and a variety of power tools being used to murderous effect the heavies are a mix of corrupt boston cops and assorted russian mafia the latter sporting villainous facial hair and scary tattoos theyre no match for denzel washington however even though hes looking a little on the paunchy side in a finale that manages to be more unlikely than whats gone before he takes a short trip to moscow to finish off the main heavy one vladimir pushkin no less daft but highly watchable,-0.9615,0

Denzel stands out in the role of a vigilante that protects his friends against villains .,ma-cortes,25 September 2022,7,once again denzel washington is perfect as usual as the vigilante robert mccall distributing justice expeditiously this is an action drama of an merciless avenger with full of intrigue action tension thrills and violence previous spy denzel is turned vigilante and taking the law into his own hands former marine and defense intelligence agency spy robert mccall denzel washington lives in an apartment complex in urban boston he carries a serene and quiet life as an employee at a boston hardware store a man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him cannot stand idly by when he meets a young girl chloë grace moretz under the control of ultraviolent russian gangsters instead he comes out of his selfimposed retirement to save a young girl mccall becomes the goto man when the helpless require the kind of vendetta they would never find without his skills and acting as judge jury and executioner he assists the distressed people with the help of his secret services friend susan plummer melissa leo who delivers him information enough and shes married to brian plummer bill pullman when one of mccalls friend is kidnapped and another is found dead he seeks for vendetta what do you see when you look at me there is no equal there will be consequences dont go to war with him what do you see when you look at me this first outing in the equalizer series contains suspense noisy actionpacked gunplay and lots of violence denzel washington with his usual stoic acting plays robert mccall a former special service commando who faked his own death in hopes of living out a quiet life and finds his desire for justice reawakened after coming facetoface with members of a ruthless russian gang as he displays amount of weapons in different locations as he uses expeditive means meted out to the brutal enemies by killing cruelly nasties this begins pretty well with interesting script by richard wenk based on the television series created by michael sloan and richard lindheim in spite of the clichéfilled storyline but denzel delivers the goods and he can pull it off the plotting in the equalizer is nothing special its a competent flick though not an action filled movie but when the action and thriller hitting at whatever cost its strong and heavy not shying away from crowdpleasing violence its a revivalprequel to the tv show from the in which edward woodward would help simple people fight back against the big nasties in the world it was a pleasantly attractive premise and washington as always convinces me as a twofisted man who sets out for delivering retributive justice and relentless vengeance director antoine fuqua has made some great gritty actionpacked movies and in the equalizer shows his portentous skills antoine fuqua shoots with his usual love of violence wellpaced set pieces and intimate scenes as well its adequate and thrilling here although his director of photography mauro fiore chooses a rare color palette that suggests uses natural light at times adding some atmospheric rain scenes aside from the excellent denzel washington we get fine good guys and bad guys performances from marton csokas chloë grace moretz david harbour haley bennett bill pullman vladimir kulich bill pullman and melissa leo followed by the equalizer with denzel washington pedro pascal melissa leo sakina jaffrey kazy tauginas jonathan scarfe among others it displays an exciting and suspenseful musical score by composer harry gregsonwilliams dark and mostly night photography by cameraman mauro fiore reflecting splendidly interiors and exteriors director antoine fuqua who frequently deals familiar conflicts set in n y keeps the film slick and stokes up the race some but this only accelerates the flicks deafening rush toward the top and ever over fuqua handles the explosive action and the psychological undercurrents with equal assurance antoine fuqua has made a lot of succesful movies such as the magnificent seven olympus has fallen the equalizer equalizer southpaw king arthur training day shooter tears of the sun bait among others rating the yarn will appeal to denzel washington fans well worth watching,0.9952,1
Could be the classics but turned to be just another action movie...,kelesays,20 January 2017,7,to say frankly i have just came across this movie by chance checking out new movies and saw denzel starring i watched the trailer and thought hmmm it could be interesting maybe something different i still remember those recent taken and john wick masterpieces rather poor plot but masterful direction and best ever action and fights so watching again the same bad russians in the usa and great deal of clichés i felt nothing but bitter disappointment well wait for another try ps russian gangsters bodies are not the canvasses for painting the more does not mean the better,0.9151,1
Expected Better! 5/10,leonblackwood,8 February 2015,5,review i had high expectations for this movie because i used to watch the series and denzel usually makes some good movies but i was quite disappointed with the outcome it takes ages to get going and im getting a bit fed up with these directors casting eastern europeans as gangsters on top of that i found the movie predictable and the characters werent that interesting i did stick with the hour film because i wanted to see the big showdown at the end which was average and i still was hoping for something amazing to happen which it didnt denzel washington just seemed to be in a mood all the way through the movie except for when he was doing his pips shuffle and the action scenes were average the girl that caused denzel to switch to a murdering assassin goes missing for most of the movie which was a bit weird and you dont really find out much about his past which would have drawn you to his character anyway its a watchable movie just because of washingtons performance but it wasnt that great average roundup this is no way like the tv series because you really dont expect edward woodward to be a assassin the director did try to use the same concept with washington by making him a humble shop manager but after seeing him kick ass in movies like training day man on fire and guns its really not that surprising that he can take out a lot of gangsters by hand after working out his moves strategically in a sherlock holmes type of way i did get fed up with the slow motion shots like when he blows up the building and appears through smoke and the whole killing loads of baddies by hand concept seemed a bit unrealistic but you cant help rooting for the denzel because hes fighting for justice budget worldwide gross i recommend this movie to people who are into their actionthrillers about a everyday man who turns vigilante after his friend gets beaten up,-0.9263,0
Heavily clichéd with annoying generic sound track,MovieIQTest,4 October 2014,None,the main character played by dw is fine but not reasonably and logically convincing the guy never worked out in the gym never jogging never practiced and honed his killing technique regularly so how he maintained his cardio and mojo his reflections his responses to sudden eruption of violence in close combat would never have been improved and kept in the same conditions as any regular man who could maintain such level a guy just like everybody else on the planet luckily got a steady job worked in the fictitious home mart stayed at his apartment after work then ritually had something in the nearby local diner or café reading hemingway a regular middle aged guy would be luckily not to have high cholesterol albeit hemorrhoid yet he could kill people in seconds even faster and quicker than the xman yeah right are you kidding me after he killed those russian thugs on the upstairs of the russian restaurant a smart killer would have clean up in situ instead he went home and washed his bloody hands in his bathroom killing people in close combat no blood on his clothes and with bloody hands openly walking back on the streets give me a break the whole storyline is overly one directional predictable and heavily clichéd and worst of all the soundtrack so monotonously annoying with fixed tempo a horrible trendy but stupid chore did by a lousy braindead soundtrack guy or group so boring and so annoying that made the clichéd scenario even more boring why the russian dispatcher would have to kill the young prostitutes coworker another pretty russian young woman who could continuously generate at least one million us dollars before she became too old for whoring she was one of the atm machines that russian pimping enterprise would like to keep yet this moron from russia chose to choke her to death for what and furthermore why she used english instead of her russian mother language in the last moment before choked to death human nature was again ignored by the stupid screenplay writers and the careless director there are so many flaws and loopholes in this movie that i just dont want to waste my time to point out one by one in case it might turn into the similar stupid soundtrack like what we have to suffer in this movie you could praise danzel washington but definitely not this oneway clichéd movie,-0.9989,0
Exactly what I expected.,teddyackerdude,3 February 2015,7,going in to the equalizer i was expecting an updated man on fire and even though it is not in the same league it was still pretty damn good denzel washington plays the role of quite avenger to perfection he is one of the few actors i believe can really do this and i would pay to watch him do it the russian villains were outstanding and well cast especeally the main bad guy he was unlikeable and i could not wait for him to reach his demise the action sequences in the movie are really well done and the only other movie that gets close in is john wick you feel part of the action and when he starts his timer to see how long it will take him to kick a i couldnt help but love the character its not a question of if he will kill every damn person in the room more of a question of in what interesting ways can i do it,-0.8945,0
Denzel is amazing and totally cool in this movie,richardpatterson-87263,11 June 2021,10,i have seen and loved all of the john wick movies so when i found out this movie existed i decided to give it a go man it did not disappoint this movie is full of action and intensity denzel is the perfect actor to play this role i cant think of any other actor that could do better than he did i love this movie so much,0.9604,1
Washington is great even if the film itself sometimes falters,trublu215,20 December 2014,6,the equalizer teams antoine fuqua and denzel washington again for the first time since training day while this outing is far less memorable than their first both rise to the occasion to deliver an enjoyable action film while the film translates the television source material with brutal and violent force it does spend a lot of time developing washingtons robert mccall to be a meticulous and ruthless killer with a heart and a high standard of morals this could have been great but for the first forty minutes of the film were seeing a routine and as routines go it is simple to conclude that it gets boring after the first minutes mccall meets a young prostitute named alina played by chloe grace moretz and discovers she is beaten to a pulp and then decides to kill her employers setting off a wicked chain of gangland violence all falling on mccall to equalize the situation as mccall is tracked by a russian mob boss you begin to start feeling the story drag out this is the point where the film should really take off but it actually slows down it tries to be suspenseful but it actually creates for a pacing mess it jumps from following mccall to following a city of crooked cops and brutal gangsters this would have made for an interesting dynamic for the film but the villains are so wooden and clichè that you cant really sink into the scenes as easily as you could if washington was on the screen despite this the scenes of action really make up for the pacing problems the action scenes are quick brutal and never glorifies the violence it shows it as a reality and as fuquas previous works show he has a clear understanding of violence and he makes sure he shows it as a frightening event my only problem with these scenes are not the scenes themselves its everything leading up to it the scenes of mccall analyzing the situation hes in are cheesy and done in slow motion it just took me right out of it overall the equalizer is a decent film that has its issues but it remains enjoyable due to fuquas competent direction and washingtons performance,-0.9943,0
"Spectacular lead, compelling storyline!",sameer-94118,28 January 2021,10,watching washington in an action role after long i had my qualms about it but he absolutely nailed it direction and sound track get full marks too robert mccall is some who can be a great friend or your worst enemy i love how he took help from his friends and didnt do this entirely on his own,0.9331,1
The Equalizer!,freshclean-66-318608,20 January 2015,7,again denzel washington delivered another good one coming after flight and guns he just keeps dropping them in a way this film was reminding me of man on fire just on a more blue collar level because of the kind of work his character did in the movie robert mccalldenzel washington is a good man who lives a quiet life but has a secret past with terichloe grace moretz being involved it does make for a typical action movie but a good one the fact that robert mccall is a good man who helps anyone around him is part of what i think makes this a good film with an actor like denzel washington you could never go wrong even if it is a typical action flick his acting is always going to be on point no matter what kind of film it is not leaving out the other actors in this film the entire cast excellently performed you wont be disappointed if you rent or buy this movie its a good one,0.9903,1

Good acting and directing yet another hero story,ojolie,18 January 2015,6,good old story line where a good guy kills bad guys a hero saves the girl and the day thanks to denzel washingtons acting skills in general casting and acting is good and the directors talent it turns out to be a good movie and not a complete waste of time however youd love it unless you are sick of a guy who used to be a but now tries to have a laid back life style yet trouble finds him and he kicks ass again so if you want to spent a sunday watching a good action movie with no original story its a good choice yet nothing more than mediocre in my book,0.8386,1
Denzel perfects His Craft...,realeaglescout,4 October 2014,10,in his previous movies such as man on fire and the book of eli denzel plays the avenger so perfectly it was difficult to believe he could substantially improve his performance and yet after just walking out of the theater i must say that denzel makes jason bourne look like wellan understudy the action is so palpable you could reach out and touch it albeit extremely violent the coactors performances almost without exception are spoton the fact that its shot in boston by the same producers as the town adds to the appeal the soundtrack is excellent eminens song at the end was a surprise well as a soundgarden track perfect,0.94,1

Not even worth my time watching it on the plane...,mrbobke,26 April 2015,3,i actually smelled the odor of a piece of riiiiiight cinema pretty early on and decided to stop watching a riiiight film for those who dont know because i just made it up is where the filmmaker tries to make you believe something so unrealistic and far fetched that you say to yourself or maybe even say out loud riiiiiight possibly followed by suuuuuuuuuuure the boredom of a hr flight got to me in the end and i decided to turn it back on many riiiiights later i got to the end i often get people telling me that they like these movies even though they know they are far fetched because they are just entertainment but when everything is so overdone that it looks like a satire but it really isnt i check out this was such a film in spite of maybe murdering villains during the movie denzel is the good guy and we are supposed to feel sympathy for him and the russian bad guys were so so bad thank god denzel is there to slaughter them all with no collateral damage hes such a bad ass,-0.9628,0
"Never believable, never boring",evito1,25 January 2015,7,this film has all the ingredients of the classic american action movie the good versus the bad america versus russia the happy end i must say that even though the film misses any sort of true storyline or plot and never fails to amaze in its total implausibility never at any point did i get bored or want to turn off the movie i guess that it is only the quality of the performance by denzel washington that makes you forget about the lack of storyline and the unrealistic superhero capabilities of his character which is a complement for him but not so much for the script itself a decent watch for a lazy rainy sunday afternoon,-0.6256,0
"Finally a serious, violent and dark movie! Thanks, Denzel!!!",QCTeamkill,25 September 2014,9,dont listen to people saying the movie is slow trust me the movie is everything except slow it wasnt action heavy but it had some good characters good action and amazing performances the best parts were the moments where robert and teddy were face to face i would like to see more of these scenes the best part was the final action bit where our hero uses everything he can to kill the bad russian guys from spears to barbed wire to drills did i forget to mention glass and nail guns the ending sets up a sequel so be sure robert denzel will be back for more he is the equalizer the flaws are the main villains deaths which were weak i also missed scenes during daylight,0.9147,1
DENZEL DELIVERS,essentialmedia-46547,17 November 2019,7,proof that some actors can be perfectly cast and bring an average production into a good workable one the story is typical the plot twists predictable and the action a little bit too optimistic but all that doesnt matter when you have the universal trope of justice delivered with superb bare faced acting of a character brought to life as denzel does,0.9452,1

Seen it all before,bowmanblue,28 February 2015,6,okay maybe im missing something or ive become simply too cynical to appreciate the equaliser if you check out the reviews youll notice that theyre overwhelmingly positive im not going to slate the film but i certainly wouldnt say that its as good as the majority of people seem to think in fact i cant really think of anything negative to say about it but then i also cant think of anything positive to say about it either we have denzil washington as the star naturally hes a great performer and puts in a decent enough show as a man with a dark past who has lethal ways of getting revenge on those who set out to harm the innocent the film is shot nicely stylish every now and again youll get a fast paced montage of images with highlight the directors flare the action scenes are nice if violent naturally and everyone gets whats coming to them and theres a decent enough amount of other stars ala chloe grace moretz and bill pullman to make this a little more than just a mindless bmovie action flick yes for all the plus points i found the film pretty average bad guys hurt the innocent once man stands up to them despite everything thats good about it i just felt that ive seen it all before and no matter how flashy and violent the action scenes were i still found it was one of those films where you could do the ironing while you were watching it or nip out for a drink and you wouldnt have missed that much perhaps the most average thing about the film is the badguy how often have we seen russian gangs bullying their way around america the lead badguy is just a badguy hes completely generic yes hes evil and will kill anyone who gets in his way but arent all villains seriously he could have been replaced by any actor and the film wouldnt have changed much so ill end by saying that most people seem to like it so maybe you should take their word over mine im clearly in the minority here but i didnt hate it i just didnt see anything that i hadnt already seen a hundred times before,0.5662,1
A worthwhile watch thanks to Denzel,r96sk,9 September 2022,8,denzel washington saves the day theres nothing id consider special about the equalizer though thanks to a typically stellar performance from lead washington i still had a fun time watching this release its a great showing from denzel not that that is a surprise given he is alongside leonardo dicaprio my favourite actor otherwise its a pretty standard vigilante action flick which probably goes on for slightly too long and features some forgettable if solid support castcharacters the latter is especially true for the rather plain villains the music is also standard though does improve towards the end with the final score and end credit soundtrack all in all a worthwhile watch thanks to denzel im hoping the sequel whilst still featuring a top lead performance is more of a well rounded effort i guess ill soon see,0.9805,1
Why the Equalizer?,tcasavecchia,19 February 2015,7,i guess the real reason why is the studio still thinks the name the equalizer still is a draw while i thought this film was ok a fairly mediocre action film my real problem with it is its title as a fan of the show in the s i was eagerly looking forward to seeing this it bares very little resemblance to the show on which it is based not that i dont like denzel but i personally was hoping for someone that audiences have seen in a role similar to the tv show in that respect i was hoping for timothy dalton regardless this film is as i said neither great nor horrible if you like action films it is worth seeing but as a fan of the show i just wish they had called it something else rather than getting my expectations up there with what was a fine show for its time period,0.9581,1
Quite brilliant,MAYESY-44,6 June 2020,10,this movie is great an unsuspecting hero to normal people but we know his past and the way he takes everyone out to help everyone he needs to is amazingly brilliant the story is packed full of depth with a violent edge which is amazing,0.9311,1
Good movie,afura-78800,26 January 2022,7,the movie starts good but after hour it gets a bit flat and it takes out the tension and then again at the end the tension comes back it is not a bad movie but i prefer man on fire over the equalizer if you like vengeance movies and havent watched man on fire then do it i am curious to see and to know what is going on in the equalizer i will probably watch it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow conclusion i recommend the movie,0.4723,1
Good acting but turns into Steven Seagal movie,rogerg100,28 September 2014,5,the characters develop the story unfoldsthen after minutes it turns into a steven seagal movieplayed with denzel washington this is not as good as heat training day i think i prefer kevins costners days to kill about times over this i hope he is the good uncle in the next movie the movie is not original at all the ending is pathetic careless the characters become inconsistent and careless i should have left after minutesdid the script writers directors get impatient half way through did somebody tell them we need more steven seagal disappointed i still give it a for the first minutes and because the villain was also a good actor and for denzel it could have been easy had the middle to end of story been more believable the characters more consistent careful,-0.9705,0
Makes John Wick Look Realistic,MackMonMay87,8 July 2018,6,the equalizer is based off of an s tv show about an exspymercenary that helps people with problems that need to be solved outside the law and while the movie ultimately sets this aspect up most of the film just leads up to that point and i have to assume isnt really connected that strongly to the show denzel washington and antoine fuqua have worked together before in the memorable and very wellcrafted training day but equalizer shows that the people involved are only as good as the script and thats where the weaknesses of this come into play as well as some silly editing and scenetransitions middleaged men action films are something of a subgenre now after taken with multiple franchises and installments based around the concept including the very popular john wick series you always use a jury of your peers so john wick is the peer to something like equalizer and is better because wick established a stylized alternate world to our own and had wellpracticed choreography without jumpcuts edits and slowmotion wick also got beaten up and ran out of ammo several times in the movie and had to be saved by friends more than once in short he was skilled but still human denzels robert mccall almost never expends a shred of effort with planning skills that would make batman look like a sloppy procrastinator its still fun for what it is and chloe moretz martin csokas and the rest of the cast do a great job in their roles but the movie gets more and more absurd as it goes in terms of how resourceful and skilled mccall is to the point that he singlehandedly takes down a wing of the russian mafia disrupting their entire operation in boston and then travelling to russia and killing the kingpin all without much effort even though he does sustain a gunshot wound to the shoulder which isnt a big deal to him i love seeing heroes take on the bad guys its a great timeless fantasy that can be very rewarding and inspiring if done well but the equalizer takes any suspense and drama out of the equation and theres very little struggle on the part of the hero wick got outclassed in a handtohand fight and james bond routinely gets knocked around in his outings but its hard for me to root for a hero who at some point doesnt get taxed or pushed no matter how resourceful they are its saved by denzels solidasalways performance and the rest of the cast but the equalizer has material that has been way better by much better productions,0.997,1
The Equalizer,abouhelier-r,2 October 2014,9,a man believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and has dedicated himself to beginning a new quiet life but when he meets a young prostitute under the control of ultra violent russian gangsters he cant stand idly by he has to help her the equalizer is directed by antoine fuqua and stars denzel washington direction of this movie was discussed for a long time indeed it had been told that nicolas winding refn was first approach which i can perfectly understand as there are some refn violent scenes brand throughout the film i love denzel washington he could make a movie about a man sitting on a toilet for the entire movie ant it would be a good thing to watch however this film is a little bit more violent than just a man sitting on a toilet more exciting as well and denzel washington is the one thing that carries this movie along from the beginning to the end and gives it the credibility it deserves i really enjoyed the movie on the one hand because denzel washington sells every scenes hes in he makes the over the top violent nature of this movie fun and more acceptable and on the other hand thanks to marton csokas playing a pretty strong villain seeing them both interact is one of my favourite part of this movie my favourite scene is in fact both of them having a pretty deep and serious conversation in a restaurant this movie is violent which can turn off some people i have to admit that some violence may be over the top and unnecessary sometimes as well as some side plots for instance chloë grace moretz character bring him back into this world and totally disappear for the whole movie as an older bad ass character denzel washington is extremely compelling and endlessly watchable but i was expecting to learn a little bit more about him though i like roles like this played by actors like him or liam neeson as well they are good and smart nothing about those guys is uncool finally the equalizer is totally aware of itself there is no deeper meaning no oscars nomination pretending this movie knows what it is it knows what it wants to do and does it thats all overall the equalizer is really entertaining i loved it the action is good denzel washington is great the villain is strong but the story has some holes in it,0.9981,1

Denzell is one of the best actors in Hollywood,Diablo1616,24 March 2020,7,the movie was amazing and will probably stay as one of my fav action movies ever and to make matters even better denzel washington is the movie and his performance in the movie was impecable and so was the main antigonist performance the action was well layed out and sought through although there are some scene kinda get me boring but the story and emotion put into this movie is just great and the music in this movie are amazing i even downloaded some of them on my phone so i could remember how it feels to be a badass like denzel and the final fight of the movie where denzel faces off against marton and his gang in the super market was if not my fav scene of all time and the way denzel finishes off marton was just soo badass and sick when i heard they were making a sequel i was the happiest man alive and when i watched it i had the same amazing feeling as when i watched the first one my honest opinion would be something like or but i just love this movie soo much i have to give it a,0.9945,1
The Best Action Movie of the Year and One of Denzel's all time best!!,mmjnr10-71-780778,25 September 2014,10,i had the chance to watch this this movie today on its opening night here in dubai and i intended not to check out either its ratings on imdb nor watch the trailer or even get to know the plot summary i just went in there with no prejudice hoping that denzel washington will deliver a decent movie as he usually does and make up my mind on it without any influence by rating or user reviews and to my amazement and amusement i got much more than what i bargained for in fact i was in front one of denzel washington best and most memorable movies of his entire illustrious career especially on the action side this movie easily compete with some of his finest including training day and man on fire and to me it was better than both you see if you tell the story line to anyone he would easily say been there done that yet a great film doesnt necessarily have a unique story line even the simplest of stories can create a blockbuster depending on how good the story is and how it was made here the story deliver the ultimate fight between good and pure dark evil and again it is almost a mission impossible with one guy fighting an entire special forces army so throughout the movie you are guessing what will happen next yet as any good memorable movie this one is not all about fight scenes which are extra ordinarily done by the way and more real and dark than any of your average action movies nowadays yet the good about this movie is the drama and act part are simply exquisite with some really memorable scenes and lines by danzel and the crew thats why may be some people felt it slow at times as they may be came in only for the action yet if it was all action then may be you aught to watch a bruce willis action flick instead for if it was just a continuous shallow fight scenes it will easily loose its depth and turn into a comic show rather than a good movie this movie is an epic action movie that i believe in a few years from now shall be more appreciated than it is today because people sometimes dont acknowledge how good a movie is until they hear more about it and probably watch more times to sink in this movie puts denzel washington character in the ultimate test with him taking on an entire ruthless russian mafia mob with all their power and influence and with a super bad guy adversary played by the dark and sinister looking marton cokas who was excellent in his rule and provided that ultimate adversary atmosphere that is one of the most vital elements of a good action movie just like it was the case in james bond movie casino royale here again we get the same level bad guy if not more dark and sinister i recommend this movie to everyone out there want to see an epic action movie that delivers to every sense of the word and im not who could be easily convinced with good action no matter how big and famous the cast were so here my evaluation has nothing to do with danzel washington being in the lead role yet he fits it perfect and deliver one of his best movies to date,0.9936,1

Another Hit By the Denzel Washington/Antoine Fuqua Dynamic Duo,TheBrewBuzz,2 October 2014,10,the equalizer is the latest film by acclaimed director antoine fuqua now i feel a little embarrassed not knowing this directors name by heart because he has quite a few very respectable films under his belt if you also do not recognize the name of this extremely talented director let me shed a little light this guy is responsible for training day tears of the sun king arthur and of course the movie in discussion the equalizer satisfies in all the ways his other great films do but the directing talent is just one factor that makes this movie so great a movie can have a superb story amazing cinematography and mesmerizing writing as well as directing but without the talent to deliver it all it finds itself lacking this is where the gifted cast comes in notably the star of this film denzel washington denzel washington is so talented he just makes almost every film he touches a hit his performance in the equalizer is no exception i often think about these great veteran actors and actresses who just refuse to pass their prime a lot of these performers are getting a little seasoned and makes me wonder if they can still pull off a great movie especially an action one actors like liam neeson sylvester stallone and bruce willis are some to name a few however they refuse to be outperformed by some of these younger actors and far surpass them in authentic entertainment denzel washington is one such talent the equalizer is about a man with a mysterious past named robert mccall denzel washington robert mccall is a kind man who is extremely tidy and lives according to schedule he works at a hardware store and is respected in his workplace he gives a helping hand to those in need and encourages them the buildup of this character makes the audience automatically like him he is a person everyone wants to know and a friend everyone wants to have as i said he is extremely likable however as with most interesting characters he has an unknown and mysterious past i am not going to spoil anything but lets just say this guy can hold his own almost any situation robert mccall finds himself unable to sleep most nights and befriends a young prostitute named teri chloë grace moretz whom he meets at a late night diner basically the plot unfolds when teri finds herself in distress and robert mccall finds himself reluctantly resurfacing a former skill he vowed to never perform again to help her this causes a chain reaction of hostile events to unfold forcing mccall back into a life he thought was behind him the villain in this film is teddy marton csokas i have to say i was pretty impressed with this character he just made a great villain marton csokas has come a long way since his role as yorgi in xxx i was very impressed with the progression in his acting abilities his performance was another key factor in the success of this film so my verdict for the equalizer is definitely two thumbs way up this is all around a very entertaining film the story is great and builds a strong foundation for the characters the action and fight scenes are choreographed nicely the acting talent really draws the audience in and the directing is very commendable in short the equalizer leaves the audience fully satisfied and wanting for nothing i encourage everyone to see this movie i really enjoyed it and know most of you will also until next wednesday i wish you all great cinematic experiences read more of my reviews at thebrewbuzzcom,0.9993,1
Fun time,eoinpgeary,18 April 2023,7,yea i liked it i heard there was a third so i said i may aswell give them a go and i enjoyed myself pretty basic story of a man helping a girl in the wrong profession and things escalate as there is more than meets the eye i think denzel elevated the movie his character was good we didnt get absolutely loads to him but it was enjoyable it felt more like movie over action which can be good yes i would have liked a tad more action but it was all enjoyable i wouldnt rave about it its decent and if you are looking for action packed i would pick john wick over this not comparing both very different looking forward to the second one i give this a,0.982,1
Comedy of the year!,aklimis,27 September 2014,1,alright so i was dragged to imax and had to pay pounds to watch over two hours of headacheinducing visualsound effects ridiculously unrealistic characters logical inconsistencies and a shameless glorification of gore violence if you want to use far fetched gore scenes then at least have a plot that can back them up so its a huh anyone praising this film is either under years old or completely out of his mind wont be watching any denzel washington flicks anytime soon shame on a socalled established actor for taking part in such an atrocity i would give it a zero out seems that imdb doesnt have such an option tho,-0.6222,0
The Equalizer,Falko_h1,12 May 2024,7,in the equalizer denzel washington once again proves why hes one of the most compelling actors of his generation directed by antoine fuqua this actionpacked thriller is a gripping adaptation of the television series infusing it with modern sensibilities and a hefty dose of denzels trademark intensity the supporting cast also delivers solid performances with chloë grace moretz bringing vulnerability and depth to her role as teri their chemistry is palpable lending emotional weight to their scenes together marton csokas deserves praise for his portrayal of the chillingly menacing villain teddy his portrayal is suitably menacing serving as a formidable foil to mccalls relentless pursuit of justice director antoine fuqua infuses the film with a gritty and atmospheric aesthetic capturing the dark underbelly of boston with a keen eye for detail the action sequences are expertly choreographed and executed showcasing mccalls lethal skills with visceral intensity from brutal handtohand combat to tense standoffs each encounter is pulsepounding and adrenalinefueled keeping audiences on the edge of their seats where the equalizer truly shines is in its exploration of moral ambiguity and the nature of justice mccalls actions blur the lines between heroism and vigilantism raising thoughtprovoking questions about the nature of right and wrong as he confronts corruption and injustice he is forced to confront his own past and the demons that haunt him however the film is not without its flaws at times the pacing feels uneven with certain scenes dragging on longer than necessary additionally some plot points feel predictable robbing the narrative of some of its tension and suspense despite these shortcomings the equalizer remains a thrilling and engaging ride from start to finish in conclusion the equalizer is a captivating thriller anchored by denzel washingtons powerhouse performance with its gripping action sequences compelling characters and thoughtprovoking themes its a worthy addition to the genre while it may not reinvent the wheel it delivers exactly what it promises a pulsepounding edgeofyourseat experience that will leave audiences craving more for fans of action cinema and denzel washington alike the equalizer is not to be missed,0.941,1
Better than I had expected,bugus92,11 December 2014,8,my expectation were not high when i began watching this movie mostly due to the fact that there are a dozen movies like this out there with similar russian mob clichés but i am a huge denzel fan and i must admit that there is a part of me that enjoys watching people get brutally punished for their sins this movie made me feel happy happy that justice exists at least in the movies it gives me a break from the harsh realities of life and how helpless we are when it comes to crime syndicates i enjoyed this movie more than i had expected particularly the music which just seemed very dark and appropriate every man has a sadist hidden deep inside of him and since we live in a civilized society take out your frustrations by watching this movie it worked for me it should work for you,0.3291,1
Decent but failed to live up to its potential.,Bruce722,24 October 2015,6,i had high hopes for this movie and while it largely lived up to them i felt there were some glaring flaws that couldve easily been avoided which wouldve resulted in a superior film for one antoine fuqua did a mediocre job with the directing role it almost felt like he had never directed a film in his entire life found a list of all the cool camera tricks angles and cinematic effects and felt compelled to include each and every one of them how did this impact the movie it made it seem as though it lacked any identity whatsoever secondly there is a critical moment in the final major conflict resolution that is just terrible to avoid spoilers lets just say that the protagonist that had been established throughout the film makes a decision that he would never make that combined with the plot getting a little out of hand made the last quarter or so of the movie hard to swallow it wasnt all bad however as the rating should reflect the acting was great and fighting sequences were done incredibly well the build up and initial character and plot development were fantastic too unfortunately this film suffered from having a director who wanted to do everything instead of making a great movie,0.9201,1
One of My favorite movie ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,11 February 2020,10,strengths the combination of antoine fuqua and denzel washington robert mccall is one that always works they bring out the best in each other while this isnt one of denzels greatest acting jobs he does way more with the role than youd expect the movie does a good job of showcasing how nice of a guy mccall is which makes his violent outbursts way more interesting the action scenes are well handled i loved the way mccall would see things in slow motion before acting them out they hold nothing back in terms of violence making sure each scene looks as brutal as it needs to be and thanks to the tension built up by fuqua,0.9392,1
Great Performance By Denzel Washington.,bongy-35412,20 March 2019,7,you can notice several things in this scene when mccall start analyzing the area first thing he notices is that the thug thumbs back the hammer he also notices the thugs eyes are unwavering and are at a fixed point that shows that the thug wasnt bluffing and he had the intention of killing the woman for the ring he also notices the tattoos on the thugs hand and neck indicating that hes a part or was a part of the aryan brotherhood and is likely done prison time increasing the chances that he wouldnt hesitate to kill the woman after that mccall is weighing his options he could kill the man in seconds and be done with it but there was the risk of the woman being killed in the struggle and as soon as the child walked in he realized that there was even a higher risk of not only the woman getting killed but also more innocent bystanders he figured the best bet was to let the man get away with the money in the ring and then deal with him later i love the way those scenes are shot no words need to be spoken its all done visually,-0.6824,0
Good action movie with story.,saptesh786,9 October 2020,9,it is a good action movie with strong story actions are classic and believable not foolish or unrealistic like in many action movies denzel washington is perfect in his role his electrifying actions really impressed me mostly silent but sharp and smart mind proper guidance and ever help behave to anyone those are characteristic of denzels role is inspirable only complaint about we do not know his past very well if director give some glimpse then it would be more better the fight between smart and dangerous bad men and clever sharp minded hero is perfectly enjoyable for every action lovers almost all characters are perfect in their roles must watch,0.9915,1
A brutal retelling of a class TV series not that thats a bad thing,InMyHonestOpinion,8 January 2015,7,the equalizer when i was a younger boy one of my favourite shows to watch was the equalizer edward woodward starred ion the s tv show which i absolutely loved now when i heard it was being remade at first i was pretty excited all these actors who could i envisioned living up the mastery of robert mccall but when i seen denzel washington my first thought was wtf i was horrified how and why why would they do that sure denzel was great in man on fire and pretty much exactly what a real life robert mccall would be so its taken me a while to sit and watch this one just for the simple fact i wasnt happy with the casting choice and couldnt see justice being carried out i didnt want my childhood ruined robert mccall is a solitary man a man who has routines and runs his life by them robert mccall also has a secret one that only the closet to him will ever know every night robert takes his tea bag wrapped in a cotton napkin and walks to his local diner where he always sits at the same table always places his book in the same position always arranges the cutlery the same way every night without fail he will be there over time he has formed a simple relationship with a young russian singer songwriter who also frequents the diner and has her own secrets by day robert works in the local diy store serving his customers the best he can one thing you dont want to do though is pss robert off and you really dont want to hurt his friends the equalizer is a brutal film its hard core no holds barred action sequences will be enough to force a lot of viewers watching the scenes play out through their fingers robert mccall is unforgiving he is a character who sizes up a person and a room in matter of seconds i will admit denzel washington man on fire fallen who plays robert mccall was actually great as the man he recreated and i didnt despise him as much as i thought i would i would even go as far as saying perhaps its better to watch this remake of the tv series with a fresh set of eyes denzel does his best to make robert mccall his own and really does it well antoine fuqua olympus has fallen training day really has made a name for himself as a director with his own style as far as action films go i think he has a great eye for detail he knows what is needed to make the scene perfect greatest thing going for him is he likes his viewers to see what is going on in the action sequences something a lot of directors have forgotten the film also stars chloë grace moretz kick as hugo as teri and marton csokas who is actually quite unforgettable in his role as terry the equalizer will leave you wondering at first where its going as the beginning is quite slow but once the action picks up it leaves you wanting more my only critique would be the few plot holes that are very apparent as the film plays out its not a game changer as anything can be forgiven if given a chance,0.995,1
Completely astonished how good this film is...,InnerWisdom1000,17 September 2023,10,i only watched this film for the first time today like everything i watch i never have expectations as that opens one up to disappointment but if i had i would have presumed it to be a good film and help pass a nice evening i would have been wrong the script here is nothing new we have all seen likewise before but this was far more compact and loved the overt good versus evil messages throughout denzel washington clearly shone and carried this film but all others for me gave fine performances it was the direction that was the standout for me the attention to detail given to scene after scene was a sheer pleasure that most directors seem incapable of reproducing let alone exceeding the music score was a superb accompaniment to the stellar film direction and never felt invasive if only we had more equalizers to spread this kindness and eliminate the pieces of evil who so despairingly contribute to destroying the world we live in if only,0.8485,1
A tad too over the top,nealkattman,19 July 2018,7,there is no bigger fan of denzel washington than yours truly dude is just great at his job when a persons chosen profession is to portray other people than yourself its going to require a lot of studying or maybe just a lot of common sense i think almost anyone with enough nerve can probably do some acting all you have to do is watch how other folks do things in normal circumstances and imitate them yeah right denzel does every personality known to man in the most convincing way from the super dork to the cerebral peace keeper to the slightly deranged family man to the lovingly hateful detective i like real stuff in movies the kind of thing that is actually possible for me or someone i know to witness on a given day the one man army kinda movie is not really in that realm i mean does anyone actually have an affiliation with a person like this please tell me where these people live hollywood has always done a good job of making marvel comic heros seem to be normal they make gotham city and metropolis look like everyday cities that just happen to have a dude in tights flying around saving days like kids save baseball cards but i believe this should type of movie has its place a place for anyone other than dw i dont know i just think hes above this kids stuff stuff that just cannot happen,0.9549,1
Black Rambo in a mall,potrik_voznik,12 January 2016,2,the movie started pretty good thats why its getting the extra star but i swear i was laughing when it finished the best part was when robert mccall denzel washington killed the russian mob with that nailing machine and turned around and left when ralfie was shot twice and scared to death in the control room meters away hahahaha awesome robert i can not even say until what point i was enjoying the movie it gradually went down until i was not taking it seriously any more i liked his skills in this kind of action movies we usually like when the guy knows what is he doing like liam neeson in taken or matt damon as jason bourne may be denzel was actually too good kinda analytical almost a superhero he could be one of the avengers if he would have batman gadgets he would beat batman i definitely didnt like how overloaded he was of all the stuff a guy who has been living a peaceful life for years and suddenly the girl and the russian mafia ralfies mom and the corrupt cops and the robber in the mall who he had to find somehow this is like when a random guy gets bit by a spider and becomes spiderman and suddenly all around is crime come onthe girl and the russian mafia was totally enough to make a story now the russian mafia when you watch a documentary about them they look like more scary and more smart so to go to see one of the mobs you have to go through a room where chinese people are counting tones of russian corrupt money are you serious and this guy gets in there and walk seeing all of this with no problem thanks director for not making him go there with a go pro hero camera with a selfie stick then this mall situation you know when someone gets trapped in the cleaning room and makes a bomb with the cleaning products and remember when rambo prepares all this traps and things in the jungle this two things mixed in one in a mall where he has got everything he needs such a stupid idea first of all i dont understand why would he go there without a gun but ok but why wouldnt he take any of the guns of all this people he kills instead he gets this nailing machine and you see denzel in slow motion cocking a nailing machine the only thing missing was the name bosch on the side of the it ridiculous to sum up in two words bad movie,0.3046,1
Formulaic but decent,gilesadhamilton,12 December 2021,7,formulaic actioner set apart by the reliable denzil as a retired spook with superhuman powers implausible but passes the time agreeably poor shoot out cliche ending prevents an rating,-0.5267,0
Best Black Action Star,maglulu,2 September 2023,10,the movie was amazing and will probably stay as one of my favorite action movies ever and to make matters even better denzel washington is the movie and his performance in the movie was impecable and so was the main antigonist performance this felt like a complete movie a complete action movie that was fully developed in terms of plot characters action and almost everything it had to offer the equalizer is a remarkable action masterpiece denzel washington isnt just a great actor hes also one of the top action stars of hollywood as a killing machine who is equally disciplined and caring his performance is a sight to behold every other cast member has given possibly their best,0.9662,1
"Good movie, could have been better",UsernameHype,17 July 2015,7,older black john wick does good things for people as the antagonist from xxx hunts him down in all seriousness the equalizer has some good action good cinematography at times and it was entertaining i marked it down because some of the dialog is not delivered great and the story was a little generic and predictable the way john wick handles it by not screwing around with a story and just getting right into was the way it should be done the story of this felt like it was trying to give him a purpose to do these things when you could have just done them from one incident it also tries to tell you why he got out of the businesses they give you his whole backstory john wick implies it which it great it leaves some mystery overall good movie but john wick did it better i wont be buying it but will probably watch it a second or third time if nicolas winding refn would have stayed and directed it it would have been great,0.4401,1
Surprisingly very watchable. Denzil is on top form.,kindofblue-78221,4 January 2022,9,i expected little from this but for so much i remember the original uk series that wasnt exactly anything but corny and clichéd denzils version is way better and much more professional the fighting is way better than in john wick overall this is a very good film denzil is excellent as ever and leaves his indelible stamp on the film and countless baddies,0.9541,1
Good rent at redbox,gianlucamarzano16,19 January 2015,6,the equalizer is about robert mccalldenzel washington a man with a mysterious past trying to stay a quiet life but when he meets terichloë grace moretz she gets in trouble with some russian gangster and robert will now use his skills he had in the past to stop them first off the equalizer is an action movie but when theres not action its very slow pace the story is okay theres a sub plot that very doesnt need to be in the story but oh well when there is action it delivers denzel washington is always great as an action star the bad guys in this movie are so plain we have seen this so many times before when will we have a great villain overall the equalizer was an okay movie with a weak story but did have some great action scenes its a good rent at redbox,0.9186,1
"I can't believe I waited so long... Epic. Just, epic.",TheMaximalApex,28 July 2023,10,i actually thought i had seen this although when trying to recall the plot i could not unusual for me with a denzel film as i always enjoy seeing him on screen i once owned a gen monte carlo because i love training day so much i pressed play on the equalizer expecting to be entertained i was glued to my seat the entire way through denzel is at his best here and does so much by doing so little the subtleties in his acting are sublime he really made me believe this character could do anything the way it played out at the start made me think it was going to be pretty good if perhaps a little average i like that especially when it just gets better and better and is so well layered fantastic character development without giving too much away and keeping the viewer guessing just enough perfectly paced structured filmed and the whole atmosphere is just a joy to behold i particularly liked the audio as this is at least as action movies go a rather quiet one the look and feel on screen is fantastic and the audio adds so much to the ambience i highly recommend giving the equalizer a watch especially if you enjoy other films with denzel washington you will definitely be entertained and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did,0.9966,1

One of the best action movies ever made. Period.,adwaidhrupendra,26 November 2018,9,i love smart moviemaking where the film doesnt spoon feed you everything and instead respects its audienceviewers to fill in the missing blanks another great example is mad max fury road this movie starts slow with an intentionally boring life of an ordinary man then ramps it up to true badassery when the time comes the optimal use of theme music and external tracks makes me get goosebumps every single time oh and ive only seen guys who can act incredibly without acting with a poker face one is bill murray the other one is denzel washington ps i love john wick but this movie outperforms it in every way possible except for maybe keanu reaves,0.7351,1
Did not feeled like a new modern action flick,dragunov-52990,25 April 2018,6,i consider this movie to be an attempt of comparing with john wick im not saying that im a fan of john wick but the equalizer was not that hitman action movie that i wanted to see i feeled like inwas watching the transporter but instead of jason statham was denzel washington the begining of the movie went slow very slow the the action began for a short moment and it was impressive i dont really know what happened but the ending wasnt as i expected or thought it was boring and too long its true that a hitman should kill without making noise or by engaging in gun fight only if necesarry but this one was a bit boring oh and the russian mafia cliche is getting kinda old,-0.5859,0
I miss Arnie...,trans_mauro,13 December 2014,1,this is one of the dumbest films ive watched this year danzel seems to be one of those actors who accept any role as long as the pay check is decent the equalizer is your typical runofthemill fullofclichés vengeance film a superultra blackops or whatever comes out of retirement to rescue a young prostitute with a heart of gold the point is that the films is a succession of a violent scenes and a hero who is as convincing as snow in july in lano plot or better plot holes the size of texas the whole things become tedious pretty fast at least schwarzeneggers films had some humor they were dumb but were fun to watch this one is another waste of time,0.7096,1
**1/2,edwagreen,6 October 2015,6,one thing that remains constant in this action packed thriller denzel washingtons mysterious former life remains just that throughout the movie what organization did he work for who were these two people from the group that we briefly see settling down to a quiet life following his wifes passing that is all upset when he meets a russian girl most likely a hooker who is being harassed by her russian gangster mates the rest of the film is devoted to denzel assuming a rambo role and killing the first group which sends others after him all we then see are violent horrible ways that denzel kills his prey,-0.9601,0
An excellent Denzel and Antoine film!,UniqueParticle,30 July 2023,8,been awhile since i have seen i forgot how great this is and i enjoy chloe grace moretz quite a bit robert mccal is a magnificent man that you dont mess with originally he had no backstory and denzel adds great subtle personality traits that mash in perfectly to an action character i figured id catch up for the equalizer coming out soon i really enjoy the flow of directing antoine has done mixed projects some are much better than others like this one is very satisfying crimeaction extravaganza holy cow the action is brutally great i cant decide if i like the first or one more they both are thoroughly entertaining,0.9905,1
I expected more but still good,Luigi Di Pilla,19 July 2015,6,when i heard positive reviews from friends i decided to buy on dvd i expected more but i was not disappointed anymore what i missed was a faster pace with much more suspense it works anyway as a solid action thriller this could be even a promising franchise for the future i can imagine a sequel because it lets some potential story development denzel washington came great here and was very cool the action and execution details were well studied but be warned there are some brutal and bloody scenes i liked the clear message in this movie for peace and not to abuse minor teenagers for fans of denzel washington this is a must see if you like this genre i recommend all taken series my rating,0.9865,1
Denzel Washington really makes the movie work.,disnotbetty-10195,21 August 2023,9,robert mccall is a retired cia agent one of their best assassins but he has left all that behind and has settled into a quiet life in boston working a to job at a hardware store but when a russian teen escort he has befriended is almost beaten to death by a russian pimp mccall rethinks retirement and goes after him and and his bodyguards what follows is a tarantinostyled bloody oneman slaughter i promised that i would never go back to being that person but when somebody does something unspeakable you do something about it cause you can mccall well word reaches moscow and the powerful mob kingpin pushkin and pushkin is not happy he funds everything gasoline weapons girls you name it hes built an intricate network on both u s coasts that are incredibly wellinsulated his money and political ties make him untouchable susan plummer so pushkin sends his very own top terminator teddy nicolai itchenko to fix the company problem in boston basically hes a sociopath with a business card susan plummer with half of the boston pd on pushkins payroll teddy has no problem finding mccall but mccall goes to teddy and gives him a warning ive done some bad things in my life nicolai things im not proud of i promised someone i love very much that i would never go back to being that person but for you ill make an exception mccall although this is more of a liam neeson style character and story denzel washington really makes it work what do you see when you look at me mccall well i did not see denzel washington in a movie like this he literally goes from a quite and meek book geek to a brutal and bloody merciless killing machine and i totally believe it much more so than i expected cast denzel washington marton csokas david harbour bill pullman melissa leo chloë grace moretz,-0.9846,0
Bang Crash Boom They're all dead,mmunier,17 November 2016,None,i usually dont mind denzel and was looking forward to see this movie slightly intriguing at first although somehow already predictable and then it became so tedious like if it was superman with a magic wand there was some good effort with mood music and sound but at times it was out of synch with the action or rather the lack of it i think i could have watch it in ff one step and save time for the same result i think such a shame to waste good actors for me one good actor for such a flat story wow i need more line i thought i said enough and i have nothing more to say about this film i found so bad and a waste of my time,0.4592,1
Tak3n?,chisoxrock1344,28 September 2014,6,the third taken film is not expected to be released until early but it seems as though it came early this time however starring denzel washington consider the many many eerie similarities the equalizer shares with the first film of the soon to be trilogy both films involve foreign villains ex government agents played by two badass actors liam neeson and denzel washington and a young vulnerable girl the negative side of all of this is that i wanted something much different the taken producers are already out their minds for making a third film unlike equalizer however taken has an actual story in taken the audience gets to experience more of a thrill ride because there were more variables to get our panties moist for example bryan mills neeson has no idea where his daughter is so he must start with minimal evidence to begin his search and the entire search process becomes gripping robert mccall washington on the other hand knows exactly where his nemeses are located so it eliminates a very entertaining component it also never comes full circle now i am not saying i need a movie to be this whole heart dropping experience but it needs to have a point and ocd a photographic memory and an internet forum that allows people to reach out to him for help is not having a point so unfortunately the equalizer turns out to simply be a film about a man trapping and killing evil men,-0.9582,0
Everything John Wick wanted to be.,douggie90,29 November 2018,8,guess which movie im describing a retired hitman agent is pulled back into buttkicking mode because the russian mafia messed with something he cared about john wick the equalizer answer yes the difference is the equalizer really just towers over wick as a film full disclosure i appreciaed the cinematography of wick and saw what it was going for but felt the whole film was flat and gimmicky more than the cool and flashy film it was going for not all would agree with me where the equalizer beats john wick is that equalizer weaves a story and plotline that is actually engaging featuring characters that you care about theres the human element to the equalizer that wick just missed denzel washington is about the best at his craft and he shines at translating human emotions through his character onto the screen further there was a redeeming aspect to the story with a guiding noble cause that excused this film from being just another actionthrilller filled with senseless violence the action sequences while not as flashy as wick were delivered with more meaning wick suffered from losing impact through running a continuous loop of action sequences that all started to blend together the equalizer took care to mind the pacing and rhythm of the story interweaving action and downtime for plot and character development the story telling was direct enough to not be confusing but left enough up to the imagination to avoid being boring for example it was never spelledout what washingtons character did for a living prior to working at the hardware store there were some interesting mcguyveresque being resourceful with your environment elements to the action that was refreshing in comparison to the heaps of cliche action films where gunplay martial arts are the only vehicles for kills the cinematography was flawless and ventured into some creative shots and techniques the big climactic ending entailed some dazzling filming involving some artful use of lighting and rain that filmwork alone is worth the watch the main antagonist did seem to be going for a very kevin spacey vibe in looks and persona the casting almost was a doppleganger for spacey i have to wonder if they missed an attempt at getting spacey for the role i felt on that front it felt that character a bit forced and cliche my apologies if this review came off as more a comparison but the two films are just so similar on the surface and in my opinion the equalizer was a superior film in almost every way,0.717,1
Entertaining movie,agmoldham,12 October 2014,6,in common with a lot of hollywood features i have to confess i preferred the first half of this movie to the second half the first half of the movie is very much character driven and focuses on the relationship between robert mccall denzel washington and teri chloë grace moretz mccall is a man leading an ordinary life and getting away from the extraordinary talents from his earlier life he befriends a prostitute teri who is stuck in her situation despite dreams of being a singer this part of the movie is extremely engaging and that certainly helps when the movie moves to a more action based focus the second part of the movie is also pretty good although theres very little of the dialogue that makes the first hour so enjoyable well worth a watch,0.9706,1
Great action vehicle for Denzil,jordondave-28085,27 February 2023,8,action despite its hours and minutes the movie didnt feel long at all inspired by the popular television series from the s you might say this could be the new and improved version since in this variation he actually kills people for a change which tv syndicate at one time always tried to avoid until hbo started helming their own programs on the first half hour or so we see robert mccall denzil washington also credited as producer as a regular blue collar worker working as security in a hard ware store that operates like a costco robert is not like other people since it appears he has a mental disorder that he has a knack for noticing small obstacles placed around him and the director seems to point that out to the audience by using close ups of objects robert notices there seems to be a diner that he regularly eats in after work and he also seems to notice other patrons who eat there as well particularly teri the young teenage escort played by chloe grace moretz who wants to become a singer by the time robert notices her not stopping by the diner one day he feels obligated to investigate and it is during then we get to see that robert is not just any other person although i notice some of the movie inspirations the real question is what are you going to do with them some of the ones i managed to pick up is taxi driver because of chloe grace moretz playing an underage prostitute who acts like the jodie foster character the jason bourne movies because of the quick action sequences and days later because of the end musical score hype was similarly different its a reminiscent of action movies from the s and s that doesnt need cgi to make it entertaining,0.9762,1
Denzalizer,engelst,5 March 2015,6,like so many big budget action flicks lately the equalizer just cant deliver the only thing keeping this movie above cheap action flicks is denzel washington his suave confident self denzel moves through the hordes much like his also aging colleague liam neeson crunching bones and slicing throats with satisfying style and skill it could make a tv cook jealous the story though stuffed with the obligatory clichés that we expect from a selfrespecting action flick lacks a believable plot what really stood out imho was a number of atmosphere spoilers one that comes to mind is building up a pretty decent bad guy and then letting him leave almost unnoticed through the back door the main flaw and a very regrettable one is that the movie fails to develop washingtons full potential the guy is pictured as a true killing machine but just when were nailed to our chairs the whole thing falls flat the book scene being extremely impressive many of the other scenes missing out either through the lack of direction or by a lack of scripting there are many cheaper jason statham movies that deliver more satisfactory action looking at those and at the first taken movie the answer must be simplicity the equalizer has too much excess luggage and ends up losing the fight,-0.6616,0
Awful trash,fbabka,16 January 2015,1,this is such a bad movie on so many levels i do not understand the imdb rating the violence is very graphic and thats about it can not get more cliché than this movie its like welcome to the rileys with a whole bunch of retard thrown in the film is pretty much a definition of cliché ex special forces guy living an ordinary life corrupt cops that he beats up ha ha a young girl caught up with some nasty shite decides to trust this guy to save her probably because of the way he stares at people its just ridiculous i walked out through the movie it really was that bad only the second time in my life ive done that and its beyond me how the movie got such a high ranking here the term ignorant masses comes to mind if you love overdone overplayed clichés you will love this film otherwise give it a miss,0.7783,1
At its best when it isn't trying to be 'cool'; at its worst when it is.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,19 August 2018,6,my opinion of this movie has been up and down like a yoyo over the years when i first watched it i really liked it when i watched it for a second time i didnt i remember thinking it wasnt particularly exciting and was too sadistic for its own good this time though that didnt bother me as much dont get me wrong this version of robert mccall is a total psycho he solves practically every problem he comes across with violence performing his efficient brutality with no hesitation and no remorse he even seems to relish his actions on occasion taking time to calmly witness the fear in his opponents eyes as he twists whatever implement he has inside them or coldly watches them die none of that particularly bothered me this time though not because it isnt an issue but because the movie simply isnt that deep yeah its hero is a bad dude so what i mean it probably should have put more emphasis on making his actions seem at least somewhat undesirable rather than painting them as being cool or whatever yet it isnt unusual for action flicks to indulge in unhelpful methods of resolving conflicts the bigger issue is the pacing of the picture which makes it far less actionfocused than it should be and leads to some fairly uninteresting segments its at least fifteen minutes too long the setpieces are usually so occupied with being badass that they forget to actually be badass yet theres a strange charm that clings to the affair its enjoyable fluff thats far more ridiculous than its aesthetic would suggest its not great of course and its definitely flawed but its a decent action movie with some entertaining sequences and a solid central performance original review theres a slightly sadistic edge to a lot of the violence in the equalizer even to that perpetrated by our hero it doesnt help that hes presented as a coldblooded killer who often stares into the eyes of his struggling foes as the life slowly drains from them someone who murders a number of people entirely of his own volition and not even in selfdefence or in direct defence of others though he does deal out death in order to help people the violence is so key to the plot being used in all but one of the solutions to the problems our protagonist aims to solve and even the movies overall arcs and messages with our hero actively encouraged to go back to his violent ways and with those methods actually being somewhat endorsed as the only real way to win even in a situation that couldve perhaps been circumvented entirely that the bloodshed feels highlighted almost to the point of glamorisation as opposed to being shown in a graphic manner perhaps more realistic than most to emphasise its consequences both physical and psychological or its lastresort nature these problems are emphasised because the flick clearly thinks its incredibly cool with several moments utilising overt slow motion and an overthetop score to try to convince you of its apparent coolness and in the process completely reducing any effect the moment couldve once had instead of letting an inherently impressive moment naturally impress at one point even making a scene literally laughable despite the fact that it shoots itself in the foot so to speak and reduces its own impact through the very techniques it uses in an attempt to enhance it the initial intention still shines through and actually makes for an experience that starts to perhaps strangely feel a little uncomfortable at times it usually fails to provide enjoyment on either a serious or silly level despite its occasionally successful characterwork and some entertaining sequences in reality the first twenty minutes are actually the most successful its probably no coincidence that these occur before any of the killing kicks off with the focus placed on likeable characters trying to help one another simply by being there and doing what they can the best moments are the ones most akin to a quiet drama and this is coming from someone who loves action cinema by the way this proves problematic then given that the whole point of the piece is that its protagonist is a vigilante theres a key difference between hero and vigilante though and the film doesnt seem to understand that theres no comment on his brutal methods or flawed morals most importantly theres no real entertainment,-0.9722,0
Surprisingly good,movie_ape,12 September 2020,8,i love denzel he is the unsung magic of action movies and in this title he is shockingly good this is a kind of revenge movie with retired ex special forces maybe guy who does good but gets caught up with gangsters it has been done several times now but here they polish the character development a little and the action scenes are top class this kind of movie makes me look at something like john wick and think why does anyone like that trash this is way classier and much better filmed solid with good acting,0.9681,1
"It has Denzel, but still a forgettable film.",KineticSeoul,7 January 2015,6,so the main thing going for this movie is denzel washington yeah i could say that about some of his other movies as well but he is basically the only thing that really stands out in this generic film sure it has some cool scenes with denzel playing this badass but its nothing really knew in this type of genre the plot is about a man with a past that is seeking redemption and retribution he is a vigilante that puts the law into his own hands and handles things like the punisher but probably not as cruel when it comes to handling the bad guys mainly because he at least gives some of them chances before he gets his hands dirty i was able to sit through this but it isnt something i would watch again mainly because its just not that entertaining in my opinion and the character development is poorly constructed and that includes the plot as well it just didnt seem to flow that well marton csokas was good as the villain teddy but his character was poorly written and his character didnt seem to bring out his full potential as the villain decent job sort of building him up and nothing the only scene that actually stood out for me is when denzels character is sitting in front of the villain in the restaurant and they exchange words with one another sort of reminded me of a scene from heat overall though its a forgettable film,-0.8139,0
So mysterious and dark,HafizhMaulana21,28 January 2023,8,robert mccall a man with a mysterious background who lives quietly and peacefully finds himself back to uphold justice after he meets a woman who is under the control of a russian gangster the equalizer brings action movies that look calm serious and dark the premise of the story is simple but still interesting a mysterious man with a quiet life becomes a perfect portrayal of the main character the plot of the story is calmly paced neat and full of action a conflict that for me is not very much brought with high expectations and is quite good the dialogue in the film is flat without sufficient intonation and emotion the film brings a smooth storyline there are not many thrilling or suspenseful scenes indeed seeing oneonone fighting action is pretty good and cool especially in the final battle at the end of the film robert mccall is like mcgyver in fighting his enemies robert mccall is played by denzel washington whom i like and am satisfied with it looks dignified calm serious and has a strong stance it seems to present the impression of being a quiet and peaceful yet deadly and dangerous person the action from denzel washington is unquestionable its just that what he brings looks like a superior and the impression of the main character who is hard to beat or the hero of misfortune is so great,0.9967,1

"The Equalizer is an exciting, high-adrenaline thriller.",mubeen710,17 August 2015,8,denzel washington gives a solid performance as always but the equalizer is of the same quality as many other denzel led thrillers without him it would not be meaningful with him its watchable special theres definitely a pleasure in watching denzel taking down tough talking baddies and thats what the film delivers no more no less the conflicts are generally well written and ratchet pressure nicely especially when denzel has some chilly conversations with his soontobevictims before they inevitably make their bad decisions the tense sitdowns were equally entertaining for me just as the bloody violence director antoine fuqua goes about his business in a more than competent manner the technical qualities are above average though the film has moments where it seems too infatuated with its slick sense of style the equalizer is an exciting highadrenaline thriller,0.1511,1
Bloody Great Action film,thomas-w15,20 November 2014,7,the equalizer i am gonna go on a limb and say most denzel fans have seen his most famous role training day denzels role of the corrupted cop alonzo harris is known as one of the biggest badass roles of all time picture denzel in training day but as a good guy that is his character in the equalizer to make it even better the director from training day returned to direct this film i cannot picture a better scenario despite some over the top hollywood moments the equalizer delivers in strong lead acting great music underscoring and equally impressive action sequences to give one of the most entertaining action films this year what i mean by over the top hollywood moments is things like walking away from a huge explosion without looking back training day was very successful at staying away from those kind of moments which is why it was such a memorable action movie unfortunately this film decided to use those moments which are entertaining but put it closer into the general action film category these select few times in the film were the only moments where i was just thinking to myself really fortunately nothing else seemed to bother me about the film now to the best part of the film denzelfreakingwashington he perfectly played this role i firmly believe no one could have played it better he wasnt just able to give you the great badass that the director asked from him he gave more he delivered great light comedy that really made the movie whole without it the movie would have been too dark like the november man the action sequences in this film were very well done what i mean is they did not bring in a kungfu master to have denzel fight at the end or anything it was just great street fighting denzels character robert mccall could slow down certain moments and see all of the angles he needed to defeat his opponent the audience really just sat in awe at how impressive it was the action sequences can get pretty bloody so if you do not like those kind of things i advise you not to see this film if you are the kind of person who just loves action movies i highly recommend the equalizer your first choice going into the theater for more of my reviews go to my website at reviewsbywestcom,0.9987,1

Such an Impressive Production,lesley_65,11 September 2023,7,i wasnt expecting to like this movie as much as i did given the level of violence however the incredible production kept me engaged until the end the cinematography particularly the lighting is superb throughout and the slick editing takes the whole production to another level the action sequences are well choreographed and the violence is never gratuitous indeed its generally not even overly graphic or sustained denzel washington was great in the lead role and martin csokas as the villain was also terrific as always even though the story is a familiar one of a reformed man of violence returning to his past sins this stylish movie adds something fresh to the genre ill be watching the sequels,-0.7514,0
Hollywood Cliché Meets Random Violence of Asian Movies,mr-giroro,1 January 2015,5,i watched this movie not in a theater but on a plane and i am glad that i did if i had watched it in a theater i wouldve had been depressed for a long time the story of the movie is extremely predictablea former special agent meets a helpless girl and he uses his superhuman ability to kill any bad guy who stands between him and the girl because this story has been used in so many movies it seems making another movie based on the story is completely redundant yet they decided to make another one and this movie follows exactly the same cliché the plot is as predictable as it can be the character development is also extremely poor our hero denzel washington risks his life and breaks vow to his beloved deceased wife for a girl whom he barely knows there is no chemistry between them nor any rational for his behavior the movie is also filled with cliché characterscoldblooded hitman dirty cops underachiever who needs a mentor to name a few the director tried to make up for the lack of an interesting story and memorable characters with gruesome action scenes that are directly imported from blevel asian action flicks although denzel couldve simply picked up an automatic assault rifle dropped by a bad guy and shot down the rest of them he chose to use construction equipment to do the job he was even able to kill a highlytrained former russian special force hitman wielding a submachine gun with a black and decker nail gun in a cowboy style shoot out this might entertain year old boy whose brain is filled with nothing but testosterone but it makes the movie extremely ridiculous the action scenes are so ridiculously unbelievable that i couldnt take this movie seriously in sum this is a movie that does not have much reason to exist you will feel that youve seen at least a dozen of similar movies in the past please do yourself a favor and skip this movie,-0.9883,0
A superhero movie without magical powers,k_balint,26 September 2023,6,the film is basically a superhero vigilante story without the supernatural stuff maybe im getting old but i realized that a vigilante story actually works better for me if its a bit more realistic and it has more time for the character and story development than wasting scenes for superhero transformation clichés of course its not fully realistic and in the second half of the film it gets unbelievable but a retired secret agent vigilante is much more valid storyline than geeky teenage boys saving the whole world from spaceworms etc and i know that there are other films like this but denzel washington makes the difference from those because he is perfect in his role you can feel the tormented life behind his act and the way he goes from his peaceful inddifferent state to a rogue hero is nicely written my only concern is that the story became a bit flat for the second half of the movie since he messed up almost the whole underworld i expected some political intervention as well especially after he visited his old boss i understand that he got a permission from the secret agency that he can eliminate a whole maffia branch which is weird by the way but i expected that this branch is connected to politicians and other legal poweful people too maybe in the next sequel,0.9726,1
A good man removes bad people,the_oak,28 January 2019,8,i liked this movie it feels right it does not feel meaningless because it teaches us something about how we can chose to live it speaks about how we can show kindness and be helpful to people we meet and people we know and people we hardly dont know it also gives us hope that bad people will not win that being good is worthwhile,0.8918,1
There is no equal,MB-reviewer185,3 October 2023,7,the movie the equalizer is apparently based on the show with the same name i have not seen the show but i understand the premise of the show to understand the premise of the movie the denzel washington movie the equalizer was a cool action movie with denzel washington being great in the movie as this guy with certain skills and someone who can go from being a nice guy standing up for people to being serious and being brutal in his kills also this movie is a brutal movie when denzel washingtons character starts taking people out or setting deadly traps against the main antagonist denzel washington as robert mccall was great in the movie he handled the serious moments very well and when he was being a nice guy when talking to his friends he was a likable character to watch and you can understand why he is doing what he is doing i liked how he interacted with his friends or coworkers as a normal nice guy and i liked that he will anything for a person to help them out whenever he can especially when he plays a character with ocd also even though chloë grace moretz was not in the movie that much i liked how robert mccall and she interacted with each other leading to having roberts past be the focus heading to cool action sequences and brutal kills that fit the rated r rating for the movie the main antagonist of the movie played by marton csokas was good and i liked the moments with the villain and robert mccall interacting with one another especially one scene near the third act the action sequences are cool and well shot with denzel washington being cool in them setting up brutal traps for the antagonists or killing them with any object nearby him in the area denzel washington was cool using his skills to take down people but what i would have liked was more background on his character because they do not say that much about him like who he is or how he has these skills in combat or killing people in brutal ways the equalizer was a cool and entertaining action movie that i would recommend giving a watch denzel washington is what makes this movie worth watching with the cool action sequences and how director antoine fuqua directs the movie the movie needed more background to denzels character and some things in the movie cannot make sense but other than that this movie is a cool action movie that is worth checking out if you like action movies and denzel washington,0.9924,1

"""When you pray for rain you've got to deal with the mud, too.""",utgard14,16 January 2015,7,growing up i was a big fan of the old edward woodward tv series honestly this is nothing like that im not even sure why they gave it the same title the only similarity aside from the name robert mccall is that both stories are about former secret agents although denzels previous occupation is never made clear who use their abilities to help people in trouble in the tv series he placed ads in the paper and people came to him for help here he just helps his friends i was mildly disappointed because i would like to see denzel play a character a little outside his wheelhouse what you see here is pure denzel like weve seen in many movies by now still despite the fact that its very different from the series i loved i had no real problems with the movie its very entertaining as you might expect from denzel washington hes one of the most consistent actors out there that puts out good movies for the masses not just for the film snob crowd its slowgoing for an action film note the runtime but its never boring theres no reinventing the genre here but everything is done in such a way that should please the majority of action movie fans for those wondering chloë moretz plays a small but important part to the story she isnt in the whole movie just the first halfhour or so and the final scene,0.8873,1

The Equalizer - Review,CharlieGreenCG,28 September 2014,6,director antoine faqua and denzel washington have only made one film together training day which earned denzel an academy award collaborating again this time for the equalizer denzel and faqua have made another equally impressive film but this time with dw as the good guy allowing us to get right behind the character beginning with the ordinary life of robert mccall denzel washington we exaggeratingly see that is a routine man and secluded life to time perfection but after befriending terri chloe gracemoretzs singer come prostitute character she is beaten by thugs not being able to standby and do nothing mccall retaliates with the only way he knows going back into his mystery past although topbilled chloe gracemoretz has only fifteenminutes screen time of the over twohour feature that with perhaps a little too much time focused on ordinary life routine leaves mccall with a rather flimsy excuse and minimal hesitation to go back to his former attacking and defending black opscommando lifestyle from then onwards dws mccall tackles crooked cops and stereotypical vodka drinking russia mobsters left right and centre as well as bonkers explosions that even michael bay would be jealous of cools guys dont look at explosions indeed presented very much as a superhero mccall before any killing sequences gets almost a spidersense vision and everything slows down as he accesses possible weapons nearby before swiftly killing at one point he clears a room of armed russian mobsters in just seconds all with a bottleopener impress yes but it sadly verges on the fantasy rather than reality washington even though a badass commando has a quiet and malice role so much so that the humorous moments whilst subtle and quirky often seem misplaced as if there should be slightly more or slightly less to fit in with the films overall ethos is he taking it too serious or not now aged fiftynine washington seems to have found the actionhero mojo later in his career as neeson did and both whilst ramboesqe killing professionals still lack the much needed catchphrases after killing you have been equalized for example the finale of the equalizer takes place bq style warehouse showdown as the action galore highlight of the film it fulfills any fantasies to kill someone with mere household tools but does a spectacular ending make up for the otherwise mediocre beginning and middle based on the almost ninety episode series from the eighties the equalizer has already had a sequel confirmed before any general release which whilst premature makes it denzels firstever sequel to any of his films with each of his latest movies racking in at least million dollars on opening weekends alone this is also a likely winner and quite possibly his first franchise,-0.9523,0
Edge of the seat action.,jmworacle-99025,7 November 2020,9,i am a big fan of the equalizer television series when they brought robert mccall to the big screen i was intrigued once again denzel washington shows his talent to create a totally different spin to a character while more physical than the edward woodward character he makes the character his own leaving the company mccall is living the quiet life working in a home improvement store he is helping a young man fulfill his dream of becoming a store security guard by working with him and making sure he meets the requirements while at his favorite diner he meets a young girl who goes by the name of teri it doesnt take a genius to figure out her profession alina wants to break free of her lifestyle but her pimp would rather make an example of her when she assaults her customer learning she is in the hospital mccall decides to take things into his own hands by confronting the pimp and his crew he offers money for the girls freedom underestimating him the pimp disrespects him and sends him on his way what surprises me is that he didnt keep the money before throwing mccall out before the dust settles the crew is dead and the pimp is dying a slow painful death enter martin csokas aka teddy vladimir pushkins answer to luca brasi the build up to the climatic battle kept me at the edge of my seat hope there will be third movie,-0.3716,0
"A Decent Action Flick, But has quite the lack of depth",syre-24208,19 September 2023,6,the equalizer offers a familiar yet somewhat underwhelming action experience while it has its moments it falls short of achieving greatness and settles for being an average action film here is what i have to say about it denzel washingtons performance denzel washington as always delivers a solid performance he embodies the stoic and enigmatic robert mccall effectively making him a believable vigilante with a mysterious past action sequences the action scenes are serviceable with mccall using his lethal skills to dispatch his enemies however they lack the intensity and creativity seen in other contemporary action films predictable plot the plot is formulaic following the standard vigilante seeks justice trope it offers few surprises and you can often see plot developments coming from a mile away character development the characters apart from mccall lack depth many are onedimensional serving as mere obstacles for the protagonist to overcome more development and backstory would have added richness to the narrative supporting cast chloe grace moretz and marton csokas offer competent performances but their characters are not fully explored their potential is underutilized leaving you wanting more pacing the film maintains a decent pace ensuring that you dont get bored it moves swiftly between action sequences and moments of reflection cinematography the visuals are wellcrafted capturing the grittiness of the urban setting however it doesnt offer anything particularly unique in terms of cinematography dialogue the dialogue is often clichéd with mccall delivering memorable but overly rehearsed lines it lacks the sharp wit and depth seen in better action films soundtrack the score enhances the movies tension and action sequences but it doesnt stand out as particularly memorable overall impact the equalizer serves as an entertaining action flick for a casual movie night while it doesnt break new ground denzel washingtons performance and some wellexecuted action sequences make it worth a watch if youre a fan of the genre however dont expect it to leave a lasting impression or offer a profound cinematic experience in summary the equalizer is an okay action film but it misses the opportunity to be something more its worth a watch if youre looking for a mindless action fix but dont expect it to be a standout in the genre,0.9804,1
Good start but then it ended up in a non-credibility mixture of MacGyver and Rambo,thay-768-728741,3 February 2015,5,almost all said in the title denzel is great and i really like him but this role is far too overpowered and all the bad guys look so incredible weak that one should ask oneself if those guys could possibly be able to rulesuppress someone without getting kicked by some school boys i like the first fighting scene in the bar which was good but then it started to become ridiculous he can kill whoever whenever wherever with whatever he finds lying around a mixture of rambo and macgyver sorry but that was far too much especially the fact that he consequently refused to use the heavy weaponry of the killed bad asses but preferred to use garden equipment or a nail gun powered by a war air pressure patron i mean look at the power of the nail gun i used some of those myself and they can never be that powerful out of the box that is just one example of an too overexaggerated hero stars because i like denzel if it wouldt been him i would give around stars,-0.9923,0
Typical Denzel Wahington film!,petarmatic,1 October 2014,6,denzel washington films are starting to look like each other i somehow could predict most of this film in advance plus it lasted a little bit too long since in the cinema city they charge more for longer films i had to pay more for this one that is not a kilometer or klick but rather konvertible mark local currency well since it lasted a little bit longer then usual i focused on many neat details in the film like the book he was reading i read it when i was a teenager old man and the sea other cool details prevail like drilling a brain with a driller or the tattoos of the bad guys all in all if you like dw not deutche welle and good action this is a film for you otherwise you can skip it with a peace of mind,0.9802,1
The black death,triggeredgamesmapdesign,2 February 2020,8,denzel washington made this film his portrayal of his character is great and you can feel the lack of emotion in his face this film is a straight up karma action film it hits all the places needed for a good action film crazy killings and a badass hero must watch film for any fan of revenge action movies,0.1531,1
Home Depot denouement not up to rest of scenes,archiecm,26 October 2014,7,i never saw or even heard of the tv series upon which this film was based i enjoy revenge pictures with super efficient warriors like liam neeson in taken and also man on fire with denzel washington and most of the killing of bad guys lives up to that level in this film but when mccall finds his way to the home depot and the hostages he has all the advantages he knows where the tools are the lights the best hiding places everything he should be able to surprise the bad guys easily one by one in fact isnt it a little out of character for teddy the efficient russian henchman to continue his pursuit of mccall given that hes totally in enemy territory a wise adversary would cut his losses im thinking wait and fight another day but mccall makes uncharacteristic blunders as well killing a guy with a drill bit is one of them even though he heated the bit ahead of time the fact that it succeeds in the movie is pure fantasy a drill bit isnt sharp enough to penetrate a skull at least not on the theory of its effectiveness in drilling into wood it is a slow cutting device that peels away in thin layers to actually kill someone who isnt tied down youd have to slam it into the back of the head with incredible force using it like that would be an iffy proposition because of balance and the amount of force needed the fact that it isnt very sharp would work against you and anyway thats not how its used here in the film the victim politely holds still while the drill slowly progresses into the brain but we dont actually see that but a bigger blunder is to get into hand to hand combat with an enemy while other foes are within yards of your position mccall does just this against the thug with all the mustache wax they fight for a full minute i dont remember what weapon mccall tried to use on waxie but he had ample opportunity to pick up guns from earlier skirmishes and should have used one on him even a sludge hammer would have worked instead they tussle for a full minute or more which would have brought teddy to the scene in time to win the day but were supposed to believe that the store is so big and the other thugs were so far off that they couldnt arrive in time a full minute come on up until then i was enjoying the efficiency and coolness of mccalls successes he was quick and always outsmarted them and he seemed to be very studious in paying attention to detail and the laws of physics as he contemplated his moves i liked the closeups of his eyes as they seemed to weigh just how quick he had to be and how accurate good stuff i wish hed kept that up all the way through,0.9405,1
Denzel was perfect for this role,nathanmanson,4 November 2020,9,they literally couldnt have picked a better actor to play this role it suits him so well marton also played his role so well because he was so creepy im a sucker for a denzel washington film ive loved him ever since training day amazing action film with a great story would highly recommend,0.9572,1
Denzel Is Back!,zkonedog,28 February 2017,7,over the past couple of years denzel washington went from hollywood alister to serious disappointment safe house was a disaster flight was okay at best and movies like pelham unstoppable and guns are a dime a dozen where was the denzel from the mid where films like deja vu and man on fire showcased him at his best i almost didnt even go see the equalizer because i was so afraid of another disappointment luckily while not perfect by any means this film shows that denzel does still have greatness in him for a basic plot summary the equalizer tells the story of robert mccall washington a genial man who works at a home repair retail store while warm genial and helpful at work roberts home life paints a different picture he lives alone a slave to routine and very little joy and frequents a latenight dinner due to insomnia at that diner robert strikes up some casual conversations with teri chloe grace moretz a young prostitute and gets to know her on a more personal level one night teri shows up with bruises covering her face the next night she doesnt show up at all this leads robert who obviously has a very violent past to do what needs to be down to find her abusers the equalizer could almost be a sequel to man on fire in terms of acting and intensity denzel plays a very similar role very much based on vengeance and shows with ease that he can still be the tough guy when needed what truly makes the movie great though is that director antoine fuqua who also directed denzels breakout hit training day knows how to utilize the great actor to his furthest potential the first half of the film is set up so well that even a paintbynumbers second half is forgivable because viewers are already snagged hook line and sinker that being said this isnt a fivestar alltime effort for a couple of different reasons it becomes a bit predictable and overthetop in the second half whereas man on fire was able to sustain both the intensity and emotional energy for the entire runtime this film drops the emotional stuff in favor of sheer brutality at times remember those scenes from first blood where sly stallones john rambo sets forest traps for the police officers hunting him well a similar scenario plays out in this oneonly involving homeimprovement equipment in a retail store i would have preferred a bit more emotion and character development specifically more about mccall himself in the movies second act but it doesnt fall completely flat because the bad guys are such scumbags that you dont mind the gruesome violence thus despite its obvious flaws the equalizer is more than good enough to vault denzel back into the spotlight that an alist career like his deserves a quote from the film has mccall telling another character you got to be who you are in this worldno matter what after a number of misfires denzel gets back to who he is with this exciting bombastic film not his best but puts him on the right track again,0.9742,1
I love this character,ngtanhung,8 May 2023,10,he so cool fast and his eyes are filled with the sadness the equalizer is a action film directed by antoine fuqua and starring denzel washington in the lead role the film is based on a tv series of the same name that aired on cbs in the in the movie denzel washington plays robert mccall a retired cia agent who lives a peaceful life and tries to atone for his past sins by helping others when a young girl is beaten and sold into prostitution mccall decides to take a stand and goes on a mission to fight against the criminals the film has an engaging plot and intense action sequences combined with exceptional acting by denzel washington that makes it worth watching besides the equalizer also touches on social and human issues such as crime violence justice and selfrespect which adds to the films interest and meaning in summary the equalizer is an excellent action,0.024,1
This was an action movie,AaronCooper-nh1,14 November 2014,6,i went to the movies to see an action film and i got what i payed for however i will say that the beginning of the movie was painfully slow watching denzel washington read in his empty apartment is not my idea of a good time however once the movie gets to denzel washington beating the crap out of russians the quality of your experience goes up im not sure if it was supposed to be subtle comedy or its a russian style but the mustache on one of the goons in the movie was just ridiculous so much that i laughed aloud the movie definitely could have gone without it anyways i was not taken by chloe graces performance as a russian prostitute it would have been better casted by someone who looked more mature like scarlet johansson i mean watching chloegrace in kick ass as a borderline kid and then watching her as a hooker was too hard to believe however if you are into action the second half of this movie is for you,0.9046,1
First amongst Equalisers,Spondonman,29 December 2021,8,i never saw edward woodwards equaliser so i went into this one with an open mind i guess theyre completely different stories sharing the marketable name however theres just enough puzzling comments made in here to make me think the previous tv series may have some missing jigsaw pieces for me for example why was he supposedly asking the cia types for their permission enigmatic nice guy with ocds and plenty of books takes it upon himself to revenge the routine beating up of a harmless prostitute by a troupe of violent russian gangsters by violently destroying them in various surprisingly balletlike ways the exhortation rings out to all baddies do the right thing if only good vs evil was always so simply and efficiently addressed by the end of the bloodfest washington passed the test to be the neutraliser the violence is concentrated cold and callous and an utterly unnecessary bore these are maybe characters better gone but to display and revel in gratuitous gore is always demeaning and insulting to the audience whether realised or not if i watch it again ill probably fast forward the obscene bits because i prefer my revenge cool fuqua certainly passed the test to be the brutaliser apart from that negative and an overlong gunfight at the diy corral its an enjoyable and wellmade timepasser and as it spawned a sequel it passed the test to be the sequeliser,-0.9715,0
Denzel's still got it!,booneboy5000,18 December 2014,6,without denzel washington the save the girl from the mob plot frankly would have been too much dejavu however denzels charisma and ability to direct the viewers thoughts away from the plot on to him saves the dayi thought it could of had a slice more of action in it but again denzels knack for capturing your every thought on to what his next move is keeps us in enough suspense to drown out the nonsuspenseful foreknowledge of the plots next move director antoine fuqua does an excellent job of giving us just enough denzel to keep us wanting moreduring the movie and after the movie is over besides who can tire of marton csokas bad guy routine hes always laid back coolcreating the impression that he has more layers of ruthlessness then he really does and last but not least chloë grace moretz succeeds in making us all love hookers i gave this movie a for denzelthe plot leaves more to be desired,0.9273,1
A boring Denzel actioner that takes itself to seriously,eddie_baggins,8 April 2015,5,while denzel washington can be watchable even when he is playing a role in his sleep like he does here there is little doubt the shtick that has served him so well in films such as man on fire safe house two guns the book of eli déjà vu and arguably others is starting to wear a little thin and when the reteaming of himself and training day director antoine fuqua who needs to show more of what he did with that film produces such a mundane and predictable action thriller you know its about time to try something a little different a revitalisation of the somewhat forgotten tv series of the same name the equalizer sadly feels like a million similar movies before it despite fuqua seemingly trying to difference itself from other such actionthrillers by ramping up the violence to and bombarding your eardrums with harry gregsonwilliams increasingly intrusive score another thing that fuqua seemed to feel was necessary was to edit the film to an at times boredom inducing hours plus and when the story is so cookie cutter as what the equalizer entails there is no justifiable reason behind this what washingtons bad guy dispatching antihero robert mccall has to do is rescue poor street working girl teri played by the annoying moretz and then kill some bad guy russians and this storyline is not deserving of the airplay it gets even though its saved by the sleepwalking through washington although his getting on in years now there is still no doubt washington cuts a commanding and often mean presence on screen that allows him to make us believe his characters even when theyre so thinly drawn and over the top as robert is here from his timing of the time taken to dispatch bad guys through to his ability to craft home alone quality traps in mere minutes robert is some form of retired jason bourne who really enjoys reading not sleeping and killing copious amounts of bad ruskies roberts history is only hinted at but his a man you dont want to mess with and washington is the reason to watch this forgettable fair as everyone else around him hams it up and fails with particular mention needing to be made of marton csokas cringe worthy big bad teddy some neat if over the top action scenes another good yet worryingly similar washington performance and the chance to see washington dance in a hardware store are the reasons to catch this wholly unoriginal and often dull slice of action its about time we see washington challenge himself once more but with his next project being the remake of the magnificent seven it looks like this tough man act is here to stay and a half late night book readings out of for more movie reviews and opinions check into,0.8025,1

More of Denzel's pious cool,chaos-rampant,22 December 2014,None,this is coherent and stylized which is more than can be said about many films middleaged bob working the home depot decides on a whim to help the tormented girl who shares the same diner and happens to be a call girl for the mob only of course hes no ordinary man zatoichilike powers of perception and just as deadly the film in fact recalls jarmuschs riff on zatoichi complete with kindly taciturn hero who lives monklike in the midst of a comicbook violence this is the american cool that comes from what we infer the lone hero has had chiseled away from him by sacrifice its not the italian cool of leone or the japanese cool of kurosawa so there is a heavyhandedness about doing the right thing a churchlike piousness which when coupled with suavely evil russians to whom gory justice is served in a myriad ways suggests just the opposite of introspectiveness the last third is a complete bust nondescript shootout and then just like that show up in moscow and back home again for the girl to pop up from around a corner and announce that she has changed her world denzel smiles understandingly denzel by the looks of it has got a new franchise to toy around with for the next several years that lets him inhabit the same avenger persona as always,0.9468,1
it's no wonder our world is so violent and we're becoming immune,clearthinkernow,13 October 2014,6,there were so many good things about this movie not the least of which is certainly denzel washington good suspense and characterbuilding we certainly like whom he likes and want them avenged i just cant see that type or amount of violence being necessary or good for the society in general its often said that in the good old days sex was implied and out of our line of vision im now voting for us to put the violence out of our line of vision also kids spend countless hours with the violent video games and movies of this type feed that appetite what price are we paying as a society how is this different than the isis beheadings there was so much of this movie that i had to turn my head from that i quite reasonably deserve a refund,0.9004,1

Leave your brains at home,martinrobertson300482,4 October 2014,7,i briefly remember the s tv show that this is based on but im sure im one of the few meaning i doubt anyone cares that this is a remake i dont and i usually hate remakes purely on the basis that theyre remakes this one is going to get judged as a denzel washington movie which i feel is what most people will be doing if they see it that said its a decent vigilante flick raised above the bulk of these kind of movies by washingtons presence the film sees washingtons robert maccoll working at a hardware store during the day and kicking the ass of badguys at night one of the badguys he sorts out however eventually has repercussions as another rubbishy badguy ends up on denzels trail wanting him dead but there is where the slickness lies off course denzel washinton is as cool as always playing the typically indestructible one man army in what is a stylish violent thriller with an awesome finale to stick around for leave your brains at home though and try and ignore the clichéd slow motion and over the top closeups,-0.4772,0

A bit off target,Fluke_Skywalker,5 January 2015,6,antoine fuquas the equalizer is skillfully made and boasts a strong cast led by the always great denzel washington but as i was watching it i couldnt shake the feeling that it just wasnt quite clicking the way it should like a high performance sports car with a bad piston i did appreciate that it took its time building up to the point where denzel inevitably begins equalizing but after hes pulled back into the world hed thought hed left behind it seems like everyone in his life suddenly finds themselves in need of his special talents and the story begins to lose its focus and momentum perhaps this premise is just better suited to episodic television despite all this i would say that the equalizer is definitely worth a watch and id be up for a sequel now that the groundwork has been laid,0.9718,1
Don't bother,connwarwicker,18 October 2014,3,the equalizer is just the same old tired rubbish youve seen before denzel washington plays the same character hes played about times before clichéd boring characters with highly unimaginative back stories dull forgettable plot slow motion walking with explosions in the background if youve seen a hollywood action film in the last years there is just no point watching this its nothing new whatsoever however if youre just looking for a mindless action film to kill an hour and half its watchable just dont expect much,-0.9231,0
"Leon, the Professional, doesn't have anything over this guy!",TxMike,22 January 2015,None,a very entertaining revenge movie not too far removed from liam neeson in taken or jean reno in leon and it has a nicely aggressive surround sound track we watched it at home and several times we had helicopters flying through our viewing room and the several explosions shook the pictures on the wall denzel washington is robert mccall he is a gentle man who works at a home depot type of store in boston and spends many of his evenings at a small table in a dive of a corner café reading one book or another but we find that he has a mysterious past as a highly trained killer he strikes up an unlikely friendship with chloë grace moretz as teri and he soon finds she is being held hostage and mistreated in the oldest profession a prostitution ring run by the russian mob bob is sort of able to ignore it until teri ends up in the hospital in intensive care after his offer to buy out her contract is rebuffed and laughed at he goes to work to exterminate the mob the main enforcer from russia is sent to find out who was doing all this and to exterminate him new zealand actor marton csokas as teddy both he and washington are good in their roles and the last minutes are the most exciting including a big battle of wits in the big hardware store edit july just watched it again really entertaining movie denzel is great edit june just watched it again the equalizer series has become a favorite to rewatch spoilers in the big store the russian guys are killed one by one using different and unique ways barbed wire to hang one of them a cordless drilling into the back of the skull of another hedge trimmers through the neck of another a microwaveinduced explosion for another but in the climax teddy was done in by a powerful nail gun then three days later bob was in moscow visiting the big boss and set things up so he electrocuted himself after his shower,0.9619,1
When a good Samaritan comes knocking.,paulclaassen,11 December 2023,6,robert mccall denzel washington is a healthconscious organized man maybe a bit too much but he is a caring and likeable character teri or alina chloë grace moretz is a young prostitute who dreams of becoming a singer these two regularly bump into each other at a diner where robert goes to read in the early morning hours and teri has a bite to eat after work when teri is beaten up by her russian pimp slavi robert takes matters in his own hands to avenge slavi and his gang when robert becomes the personification of bravery by going into the lions den we immediately realize there is more to him than meets the eye the fight sequences are brutal and well choreographed when it comes to vengeance movies i only view the protagonist as such if he only avenges those who deserve it and not innocent bystanders vengeance movies like the john wick franchise where the socalled protagonist kills hundreds of people does not interest me and i dont view him as a hero with the equalizer robert is indeed a hero and i wish there were more people in the world like robert mccall the main antagonist is teddy such a cuddly name and yet such a bad guy with a body covered with tattoos like a colouring book he is well portrayed by marton csokas who makes for a ruthless villain another villain and head of a syndicate slavi was part of only appears at the end of the film but this gives us peace of mind knowing his vicious operations will end which will free a lot of people the equalizer is loaded with words of wisdom mostly coming from robert the film is off to a slow start allowing us to get to know the character as the film develops it picks up the pace and robert becomes an unstoppable and determined force it also allows for very good character study denzel washington does an excellent job portraying robert,0.9826,1

The Return of the One Man War on Bad Guys,shaososa,4 January 2015,7,the equalizer is loosely based on the s tv show of the same name but it might have more in common with the corny action movies of that era that featured one man armies against hordes of bad guys denzel washington takes the title role as a mysterious ex government agent of some sort who is trying to live a life of normalcy but when he befriends a prostitute played by chloe grace moretz and she falls into trouble with her russian mob pimps he falls back to his old skill set to reap punishment on her accosters and washingtons equalizer aint no punk bh like the stallones and schwarzneggers of the aforementioned s films denzel is a wrecking ball of ridiculous force and wrath but while those old flicks lacked style and creativity director antoine fuqua breaks out the tricks and flash of his growing repertoire and holds nothing back in the manner in which washington dispatches baddies while i raised an eyebrow at the ease in which a year old washington worked his way through his adversaries here i was still entertained by a decent script and well shot action scenes,0.7337,1

'The Equalizer' shoots for 'great' and lands on 'good.',dastaten,12 December 2014,7,i was a fan of the old s the equalizer and i knew this modern take was going to be different so i went into it assuming it was going to be a standalone type and that i shouldnt hold it to the series i was right if youre a fan of the s series dont watch this movie thinking youre going to talk a walk down memory lane it just isnt there that said its not a bad movie it tries to be great and it lands on good the first three quarters or so are build up and the story is ok but there really isnt much there its hard to rely on story when the main character and his past are shrouded the entire time the story we do know well bad russian guys are doing bad things thats pretty much it not terribly creative or deep really the first three quarters are slow with a bit of action inserted here and there but it really picks up in the last quarter even then its only good and the ending is somewhat anticlimactic dont go out of your way to see this one but if youre out of movies to watch its not a bad flick its just not a great flick and if you havent seen man on fire watch it instead for sure or hell watch it again instead of this one youll certainly be more satisfied,0.9891,1

More average than equal,john-4323,7 April 2015,6,saw this on dvd and to be fair it starts off well but the plot line is paper thin and predicable down to the script it has plenty of action and is a good film for denzel as i like most of his past work near to the end of the film it seems the writers were asked to take a hike and a producer took over as it turns from a nice action movie to a mushy gee ma can we be american too type situation which is not required wanted or enjoyed more mush and gush than tom cruise talking about himself ugh for me this ruined what was an enjoyable experience and the last action sequences are stupidly ridiculous which also ruins then film only watch if there is nothing better on,-0.3708,0
I Can't Trust a Denzel Washington Movie Anymore,polygnotus,25 September 2014,2,sad this was barely a notch above a steven seagal movie but worse it had denzel washington in it that hurt me the movie was as cliché and stupid as most action movies this one seemed slightly unique in its bland of the revenge porn template with a slasher gore thing only the slasher was the protagonist seeing washington put a screwdriver into the back of someones skull then pull the trigger was truly the low point of his career but it was also another low point in mainstream american film the moral inversion is almost complete we have serial killers as heroes why not a madman with power tools this kind of violence is supposed to be funny the chainsaw massacre so over the top you laugh out loud but what antoine fuqua has done with this movie is attached psychopathic bloodletting with the cause of justice and this isnt just bloodletting mel gibson perfected that years ago this is psychopathic bloodletting by another american psychopathic hero,-0.4007,0

"It Could Have Been Better, But It Could Have Been Worse",Necroambulant,12 May 2015,7,the equalizer is more of a slow burn than john wick and obviously not written with the same intent to have fun with the genre and make something a little bit new in the process but it is certainly almost as good of a movie my only issue with the equalizer comes from the fact that denzel washingtons character is fundamentally indistinguishable from his role in man on fire essentially the same background can be extrapolated from both characters this could easily be thought of as having been an alternate reality lived out by the same person in both movies having enjoyed man on fire a great deal it is a bit disappointing to see what amounts to little more than a retread with different antagonists sure the motivations that set events in motion are different but that is really about the only other change still an enjoyable and satisfyingly violent movie but it loses points for a blatant lack of originality in having washington cast in what amounts to the same role he was already successful with in a better movie also there was really no need for this particular movie to be more than two hours long also it lost a step or two from the original television series worth seeing but it has been done before and better,0.965,1

Justice is Equal,aakudev,15 January 2015,6,a good better than average movie it was all about action and good old fashioned revenge for the dear one if you go with a lot of brains in the movie then you will be disappointed for sure the movie has a simple story but many things about the lead were unclear and well you can say a hero is a hero and luck and script is always with him hehe direction was good denzel was good the mafia people were also ok overall it was entertaining but as i said if you try to be logical here then you will miss the action so just go ahead enjoy the action and have a good time,0.991,1

The Equalizer: a good 'God of Vengeance' type of film.,niutta-enrico,13 December 2014,7,when as a kid i was asked what the searchers was about i told that a comanche tribe had the stupidest idea you could have in far west killing john waynes family and that the rest of the movie was the inevitable consequence of it this was my first encounter with god of vengeance kind of film and i liked it just as i liked the present one there great sceneries filled the screen here very good action fantastic lighting and the astounding performance of denzel washington nail you to the seat i dont think this kind of films has a good influence on kids to me it seemed that john wayne was right the revenge he pursued was noble and killing those indians made him a better man if a comanche tribe ever were to show up in rome and kill my family well i dont how it would have ended but you know probably i just was the only stupid kid on earth,-0.0837,0

Crescendo,mgd_m,14 April 2019,6,first act the plot has potential its a bit slow but lets see how it develops second act the villain is interesting but denzel is some kind of supernatural force i dont buy that i think this is the umpteenth silly action movie third act ok i get your point the hyperbole is so clear and so fun now that i like it i like the character who fully shows himself for what he is i like the funny killings and the bold lines this movie is a linear crescendo and i think youll get rewarded if you have patience my rating is some kind of average between the three acts,0.9778,1
Denzel y u do this?,arsasuperman,15 December 2014,4,the summary says it all he killed more people than rambo with more gadgets than macgruber this is the kind of a bad move i wish he got a lot of money for because it is not very good and is one of those what did i waste my time on plot retired mystery man with great skills who stooped doing dirty stuff because a promise to his dead wife goes against the whole russian mafia for a prostitute with a good voice witch we never hear he hangs around with when she gets beaten by her pimp to sum it up do people really think one man can kill the entire russian mafia and a few petty criminals along the way with house whole applianceschemicals the only reason i gave it stars and why this movie is different than low budget tv movies is because of the actors and their performances,-0.9849,0
Rescued by Denzel,sniffynixon-33443,10 December 2019,7,this is a pretty standard by the numbers action movie which is saved from total mediocrity by the usual brilliant performance denzel washington a film that would otherwise quickly fade from the memory if it wasnt for the stylishly filmed moments of morally questionable ultra violence punctuated throughout its length the final showdown is certainly one of the more gruesome and imaginative endings i have see in a while,0.6808,1

Denzel kicks Ass,BecauseIAmBATMAN,13 December 2014,7,the story isnt anything new or unique the plot is fairly predictable denzel plays an unstoppable badass antihero who kicks ass this pretty much sums up the film but its solid entertainment the action sequences are wonderfully executed some very interesting kills in the film without the use of many guns the atmosphere set is wonderful the film feels a bit long at minutes and certainly could have been a bit shorter but its still entertaining throughout its runtime you will certainly enjoy some great rrated violence if you are a fan of it denzel acts very well and is a badass you will root for a solid,0.9883,1
"Ok action movie, but has nothing to do with the TV series",Gray62,1 November 2018,7,as an action movie this would have rewarded points despite logical flaws like wtf leaving fingerprints everywhere however its been styled as being about robert mccall the star of the tv series but its got nothing to do with that character and that aint denzel washingtons fault who did a stellar job but that of the screenwriters and producers the movies mccaul is simply a totally different character from the tv guy so to advertise this movie as the equalizer is fraud theres no way to excuse it younger folks who dont know the series may not care about this but if you had been a fan you will be disappointed,-0.9034,0
One Of Denzel's Finest.,john_carlin,1 May 2023,8,denzel washington is one of the greatest living actors of this generation and the equaliser is a very well made film that allows him to showcase his outstanding acting abilities the equalizer is a thoroughly enjoyable actionthriller that has superb performances from both denzel and martin csokas the latter portraying the main antagonist of the movie with their sit down dialogue scene in the restaurant across the table from each other being one of the coolest and most memorable scenes in the whole movie i recently went back and revisited this movie in anticipation of the movie in the trilogy being announced and had a very good time with it if you enjoy action violence and superb acting then i highly recommend giving this movie a watch for me,0.9822,1
When Pushkin Turns To Shove...,Lejink,3 May 2021,6,i can vaguely remember watching at least a few episodes of the original tv series of the equaliser which starred edward woodward and boasted a quirky theme tune by the police drummer stewart copeland woodward in his day was a serious wellregarded if very actorish performer whose very appearance in such an action antihero role as the avenging angel of boston raised eyebrows about him slumming it at the time but as i recall the show was very successful especially stateside and certainly ran for a few series i say this because for me the idea of washington who id probably say is one of todays more serious wellregarded if a bit actorish performers taking on such a part in this glossy hightech adaptation is one i found similarly surprising its almost a black superman role as he plays by day a mildmannered heartofgold gardenretail store employee supportive of his coworkers checkedout by the discerning older lady amongst them but who keeps himself very much to himself when he clocks out he lives quietly and anonymously in a small apartment and plays the nighthawk in the evening by haunting his local diner where he eats his meals quietly reading a classic book to pass the time hes acquainted with a fellowcustomer a pretty young russian girlprostitute and its through her mistreatment by her vicious pimp that we discover mccalls secret as he turns into a veritable onemanarmy to take on the powerful russian mafia operation of which prostitution is only one strand headed by the mysterious oligarch mr pushkin mr p then sends over his top terminator teddy rensen marton csokas a mean mistreater if ever there was one as you can tell by the tattoo count on his musclehoned body as the film builds towards its inevitable faceoff between the two which unusually takes place back in the very store mccall works by day by this time weve learned that our man is a retired special operations operative who walked away from the job when his wife died and really isnt to be messed with but those pesky russians just dont see this and keep coming after him allowing mccall to devise ever more gruesome means to despatch them onebyone and of course being the kind of guy who doesnt leave a job halfdone theres a final reckoning with the big boss man in his own lair which serves as a kind of epilogue im not averse to this kind of very stylised if very violent action thriller i know my bond from my bourne although the levels of excess employed here make old jimmy and jase seem like amateurs compared to what old bob gets up to the action sequences are ruthlessly choreographed and extravagantly set up using the by now familiar devices we associate with this type of designer violence with its mix of pinpoint jumpcuts pyrotechnics super slomo and rigorous fight sequences denzel probably gets as little dialogue as hes ever had to speak in a movie as the strongsilent mccall while csokas makes for a suitable if ultimately doomed protagonist its all served up with a pounding industrialtype soundtrack just as youd expect i wont deny that i enjoyed this clichéd mindless maelstrom of a movie held together by dens eyeofthestorm lead role and as for denzel as an allaction killingmachine well if edward woodward would why wouldnt washington unsurprisingly i see the film was successful enough to spin off a sequel and you know one of these crazy old nights in the not too distant future ill probably disengage my mind again and check in on what mr mccall did next,0.5435,1
Awesome revenge movie,Valkonian,23 June 2021,8,i love this movie denzel is so good in this role like liam is in taken the movie actually pumps out some good messages the bad guys are really nasty so when denzel gets nasty on them you cant help but root for him,0.0822,1

A bottom-shelf action thriller barely salvaged by its top-drawer leading man.,shawneofthedead,24 September 2014,4,its a tantalising thought denzel washington reunites with director antoine fuqua for a pulseracing thriller about a man who seeks to right equalise wrongs done to innocent people perhaps they can once again hit upon that thrilling blend of action and drama they cooked up in training day which won washington his second oscar unfortunately washington is pretty much the only good thing about the equalizer which is really little more than a pulpy straighttodvd film rescued by the efforts and charisma of its leading man robert mccall washington keeps his head down and his profile low at his new job in a hardware store clearly hoping that the ghosts of his past will eventually disappear when he befriends teri chloe moretz a desperate waif forced by the russian mafia into prostitution he finally decides to help people with the deathdealing skills hes been trying to keep hidden after roberts bruisingly bloody confrontation with teris pimp the terrifyingly efficient terry marton csokas is dispatched by his russian ganglord to get to the bottom of things this is the kind of thriller in which the bad guy portrayed as enormously smart and powerful lets the good guy slip out of his grasp for reasons of prolonging the films running time theres even an extended sequence at the end of the film in which terry just stalks through a gigantic warehouse for something like twenty whole minutes never finding robert until their climactic showoff fuquas film is almost unapologetically pulpy too setting robert up as an ultraviolent vigilante who gives his antagonists the choice to clean up their acts before he does it for them itd have been great if the equalizer had dared to be a little more introspective delving into the moral greys and difficulties robert encounters in hunting down terry and his gang but in the bloodshed that explodes all around robert most of it caused by him in almost chillingly cold blood it actually becomes harder and harder to tell whether were supposed to be rooting for robert in the first place even as the film practically yells at us that hes the most heroic person in this entire godforsaken mess truthfully the equalizer is the kind of film youd imagine with jason statham in the lead a disposable actionthriller with murky morals that exists solely for carchase sequences and bulletplay the fact that it stars washington is both to its credit and its disgrace he makes the film worth a watch actually finding something a little human within a character who wasnt really all that wellrounded on the page but fuqua also wastes him failing to find and colour in the layers and depth washington could so easily have given robert for what its worth csokas is a worthy adversary stonecold and utterly brutal who stands up quite well against washington to be fair fuqua directs the film with his trademark ferocity and many scenes drip gore menace and tension in equal measure theres even a little welcome comedy courtesy of ralphie johnny skourtis the wannabe security guard who becomes the films accidental hero but its not really enough to save the equalizer from itself the film practically begs to be allowed to build a new franchise around its buttkicking protagonist but fails to prove why anyone but the most diehard of action aficionados would really want to see much more of mr mccall,0.986,1
Enjoyable modern day superhero type action,sickofenjoyingmyself,14 July 2015,7,this movie was actually better than i expected it was kind of a mix of bondbourne type ingenuity action with an added modern day superhero quality the type that allows the viewer to get a bit carried away with all the action without questioning how believable the story line is for me it has some great high adrenaline action and at the centre of it all is the ever cool denzel washington the story line tends to delve further into the unbelievable the further it goes on eventually to the point where you wonder how mr mccall could so easily seemingly return to his normal everyday life after such outrageous public exposure but then you remember that its all about unapologetic action and doesnt try to be particularly believable or convey any deep and meaningful message it sets out to entertain and that it certainly does,0.9294,1
Comic book stuff but entertaining,miked-26800,2 July 2021,8,denzel washington is excellent as the invincible hero taking on the russian mafia his character is a combination of steven seagal and james bond he easily takes on five at a time and finishes them off in various gruesome ways his super baddy opponent is played in very over the top style by marton csokas the fate of csokas is never really in doubt and is of course saved for the final extravaganza of violence simplistic stuff but entertaining and well directed,0.9489,1
"""Sometimes we make wrong choices to get to the right place.""",yasinhussain-14721,29 August 2023,7,a good few years ago i tried giving this picture a go i got minutes in before realising yeah im not really enjoying this i gave it another shot though some time later literally exactly the same thing occurred but with the equalizer just around the corner i thought i should watch this properly from start to finish to get an idea of whether or not the third installation will be worth my money and based on the equalizer even though i dont think a installment is justified let alone a im happy to head to the theaters to simply sit back and enjoy the action that this has to offer what elevates the first movie compared to any other ordinary action film is primarily the awesome sawlike kills that we get to see the gore in this is more extreme than your standard action flick but at the same time it isnt too intense for it to be a turnoff in the slightest it actually makes this rather exciting in addition i imagine it comes as no surprise when i say that denzel washington was superb as the silent stonefaced avenger robert mccall but the person who surprised me was chloë grace moretz who with the little screen time she had shocked me with her almost authentic depiction of the vulnerable fearful sex worker teri especially in the first act and i loved the scenes with robert and teri together we got to see their friendly bond with each other and that was delightful to witness even if those moments were only few and far between but yeah im going to have to leave it there since im really trying to cut down how much i write nowadays all in all though if youre an action fanatic and you havent checked this out already its definitely worth the watch,0.9928,1
All things are not equal,malcolmlusby-146-613669,22 October 2015,9,one of the most exceptional movies in the last few years denzel washington provides a compelling if not totally believable character working off of the television show with edward woodward the story cuts a remarkably good plot but do not expect too much from it or you will be disappointed the biggest critiques i have heard from people are that there are elements of the movie that make no sense and this is primarily because the scriptwriter has seen the original series and assumed a lot of the character into evidence but there are notable points in the movie that occur once never to be seen again that make you wonder exactly why the heck they left it in my biggest complaints are that there precious too few action scenes martin csokas owns the bad guy role to the nth degree but with a sinister malevolence rather than a kick your ass approach washington is pretty damn hardcore in this but his kickassomoter barely reaches a three on the frequency of scenes scale chloe grace moritz plays an outstanding supporting role but again there is not enough of a back story to merit the movie i would have liked them to have drawn out her situation in significantly more detail testosterone moment came from scene stealer haley bennett and her apparently endless legs certain elements of the film are just entirely too stupid to handle with one particular interrogation scene that will have you screaming at the screen why doesnt he just press the damn button other than those complaints the acting with what is a great plot but a relatively poor quantity of action is utterly superb and it gives a fine start to what could be a fantastic series of movies,0.7528,1
Denzel is Denzel.,wolcottalexander,8 April 2023,6,action is action not much more to say i thought it might be a slow burn with a violent burst at the end but the action starts early and is consistent throughout without a star actor in the lead role this movie is probably a but denzel is denzel and carries the day very violent movie some good performances from the supporting actors overall a solid entry in the action genre but nothing special i give it a rounding down to if you like action movies and you like denzel washington then sit back and enjoy i wish my local lowe depot was as clean and well staffed and well organized as the fictional big box home center shown in the movie and i wish denzel washington worked there,0.9786,1

"Morose and feisty, decent enough to catch action movie buffs' eye",Junreviews,6 December 2014,7,what makes a great action film showcasing a charismatic protagonist that bustles all sorts of powerful moves or would it be the thrilling plot that revolves around intriguing motives and cynical enemies the equalizer possesses both elements while featuring a veteran denzel washington who plays robert mccall still has what it takes to waltz through a plethora of wrongdoing by helping others and equalizing the corrupted society the movie gets intense as the days of mccall ensue it begins with an ordinary routine by showing mccall commuting via public transit and gradually foreshadows unique aura that differentiate him from his coworkers in the warehouse center then he spends his night reading in the café where he often chats with an indecent and polite girl teri played by chole grace moretz she manages to handle such a promiscuous role pretty well it will take anyone by surprise when you find out her age the prowess of washington really makes this movie worth watching as his indomitable strength nonchalantly gets unleashed in order to take out the mafia nifty swift and impeccable every movement he makes is a sight for sore eyes thus the editing seems welldone in terms of cutting and panning the scenes the russian mob and their dastardly stooges fit in well as they go head to head with washington verbally and physically however there is a number of improbable moments that put you into thinking that perhaps mccall is invincible despite his strength of being such a skilled combatant it is unrealistic for one guy to catch his counterparts redhanded in a jiffy as well as thwarting the armed group of mob although that might get resolved by the scene where he heads to the majestic dwelling to debrief his enemies from a lofty couple who seem to be related to the president it is safe to posit that mccall used to work for the united states secret service which explains why he is so formidable in a nutshell the equalizer is packed with breathtaking fights in which washington acts like the present version of cavalier it is also a nobrainer because there is neither conundrum nor mystery thus you dont need to heed the plot but let your emotion and time to be enraptured by a series of exciting and stimulating scenes that do not feel redundant,0.9824,1
Best Denzel Action Movie,view_and_review,30 September 2014,10,i may be just giddy about this movie because i just saw it and im already thinking about when ill see it again ok so the mere fact that denzel washington was in the movie was enough to get me to see it is he a good actor yes hes great but its not only that hes a great actor he chooses excellent films he has an uncanny knack to choose perfect roles or hes just that good that he makes the movies better i went into this movie thinking man on fire another denzel action movie that i loved well if you want a true reference for this movie think man on fire bourne identity and red but better the acting was great both from the protagonist and the antagonist not that the acting had to be that great because this was an action movie after all but its always better when the actors give a good performance the directing and cinematography was wonderful too the director antoine fuqua who also directed training day masterfully worked the action scenes with well timed slow motion and soundless shots even the musical score for the climax was enough to draw you in the entire movie boils down to denzel washington playing robert mccall a retired agent that has incredible skills he played the quintessential hit manassassin intelligent check creative check skillful check ruthless check ice in his veins double check robert mccall was so sure of himself it bordered on arrogance he was so ingenious it bordered on savant he was so tactically cold and calculating it bordered on robotic he was so altruistic it bordered on saintly to be honest he was a character that id abhor in another type of role just because of how pristine he was but i admired him in this role everyone loves the helper to the oppressed and voiceless in summary i loved the story the build up the climax and the ending i loved the players both the good and the bad i just plain loved the movie throughout the movie i was demonstratively trying to hold back oohs aahs yips yaps and claps its been a long time since i wanted to applaud after every action scene my favorite denzel action flick,0.9988,1
nice action movie,kwstas-malk,6 January 2015,6,there is one side in the film when its totally gripping that is when we just see the protagonist as a person living in an ordinary life often being with people and often encountering them getting in trouble by crime this grounded world just keeps most of its darkness in their presence sometimes feeling like a doomed helpless world but once the hero reveals what he truly is capable of it doesnt actually sucks out its entertainment quality but it does betrays that intriguing context nearly turning itself into a superhero movie except of course its less silly and much violent mccall in shorthand is too competent for any criminal he fights and often leaves with a perfect swagger it may not be big deal to many viewers especially the action fans who are already enjoying the blood but the film sets up an existing theme that seems to be a lot interesting to consider instead of indulging itself with its own way of justice classic american holihood film,0.9371,1
"Disappointing, as it appears to totally reverse the original premise.",skyking-14,23 September 2014,1,call it something else anything else if matt damon thinks it inspired the jason bourne stories then he clearly never watched the original series for edward woodwards the equalizer violence was always the last resort he tried first to do everything possible to expose the miscreant to lawful prosecution or forced retreat through intimidation one classic line from the original series referred to killing a man as denying him the last opportunity to change the equalizer was a man who had seen too much violence and only sought to protect not to cause further bloodshed yes it was sometimes necessary but there were entire episodes where he found a solution that didnt result in gun play and violence this is simply one more cheap hollywood violence fest that undercuts any attempt at moral authority that hollywood likes to pretend to on violence in our society im glad that edward woodward is no longer alive to see the travesty they have made of one of his most memorable screen characters i like and respect the ability of denzel washington but i will not watch one moment of this cheap knockoff of a series that i very much enjoyed,0.0283,1
Washington and Csokas steer the ship,jasonpauljones-64690,14 June 2023,7,while its predictable and by the numbers denzel washington as the protagonist robert mccall is exceptionally easy to watch even when a lot of what happens is ludicrously unbelievable csokas as the psycopathic russian is fiendishly good and the cat and mouse game between the two is hard to look away from not quite sure why chloe grace moretz is only seen at the start and end of the film and nowhere in between as she is a talent and should have been more involved in the heart of the story plot holes of illigocality are also noticed on more than of a couple of occasions and set the movie back a bit but when youre treated to watching denzel washington at his craft for hours the story or lack thereof hardly seems to matter anyway,0.2873,1
"Amazeballs, Score Unreal",georgecoffeynewyorker,1 October 2014,9,i popped along to this amazing movie i was slightly hesitant at first after all i had heard quite disheartening things at the end of the day you have to experience it for yourself you are the reviewer the plot was quite interesting but at the same time understanding mccallwashington is a lonely man sitting in a flat in what i thought was san fran but as it happens its actually in boston ma during one of his frequent visits to a local diner he encounters alienterimoretz they become friends he gives her plenny of words of advice one of being you can be anything you want to be shes working as a pip she unfortunately gets beaten up and lands in a hospital he witnesses all this from the diner window when hes not alone he works in a building suppliers company one of the days hes working jennymousis is mugged of her mothers ring and the company cash so as they did wrong to jenny mccall beats the robber up etc it was a pity thou that they kept that scene out of the film you were promised plenny of action and action is what you got hahaah so to continue raphieskourtis who is a colleague to mccall raphies house is burnt down so mccall is told when he shows up for work that raphie quit mccall finds out eventually that corrupt cops have been doing the rounds for mexicans so he blackmails them and beats them up this continues throughout the film there is a pattern you know someone does wrong to a person he mightened know that person but he goes out of his way to correct the wrong the crowd who beat up teri mccall runs after slavimeunier and his crew pushikinkulich sends another guy teddycsokas and his crew with mccall around he makes sure he dimensehses the lot body by body he eradicates em all after a fantastic finished and eradication i was saying to myself perhaps mccall will run after pushkin in the next sequel be another taken series except with taken it was dealing with kidnapping however it wasnt to be they finished the film by mccall getting an email requesting help from him so thats prob the sequel alrite one thing i have to mention thou was the music score it was fantastic i have mentioned in the past that my love of music is a must this film lived to its musical expectations every time there was action accoming we were accompanied with music it was unreal or as i said amazeballs,0.6377,1
VIEWS ON FILM review of The Equalizer,burlesonjesse5,26 September 2014,7,without hesitation i will stand by my convictions and say that the crime thriller training day was my pick for best film of lead actor denzel washington won an oscar playing a revved up popeye doyle type a la the french connection and director antoine fuqua hurled himself into the spotlight with his fast paced eclectic shooting style and signature roving camera technique now in the fall of these two have reunited again and it feels so good ha for the equalizer another crime thriller that is based on a fairly successful s television series of the same name is this film as messy powerful dark cathartic or as good as training day no not exactly but if youre a fan of washington who isnt and are curious to see if fuqua can actually make something worthwhile again lately hes misfired with flicks like olympus has fallen being a horrible die hard ripoff and s brooklyns finest being overlong and out of his collective realm as a filmmaker then the equalizer will no doubt satisfy you the audience member with a plot that seems one note at first before kicking into high gear via the second and third act and an antagonist who resembles kevin spaceys evil twin brother in the looks department the equalizer follows retired intelligence officer robert mccall washington once a trained killer and someone who supposedly had a fellow agent help fake his own death mccall now leads a boring middle aged life he works at i guess a home depotlike hardware store he lives in a apartment with basically bare walls and a couple of pieces of furniture he doesnt sleep he doesnt eat and when he does go out of his apartment he frequents a diner where he brings a tea bag with him and orders nothing but hot water strange dont you think mccall also reads books like the invisible man and the old man and the sea these books sort of serve as metaphors for the films storytelling sensibilities and likes to place silverware and cups on certain spots on a table basically hes an odd dull dude until russian gangsters a common thief and two dirty cops mess with a few of his acquaintances teri a young prostitute played by the overexposed chloe grace moretz and ralphie a budding security guard played by johnny skourtis to name two within the films first minutes washingtons mccall just like his alonzo harris in training day gets in big trouble with the russian mafia essentially the films main plot point why because he killed five of their us allies in seconds give or take they wouldnt give teri the freedom she deserves from being their sexualized civil servant so basically in the end mccall quote unquote has to find peace by killing this whole mafia chain that is the equalizer in a nutshell and what helps it rise above most crime thrillers is the intelligence of washingtons resurrected character hes one step ahead of everybody and you never sense that he is in any danger or peril the whole nature at which he goes about his situation comes off as predictable and pat to a degree though it actually works along with having a similar or almost identical film score to training day as mentioned earlier and eerily possessing its various camera angles the equalizer didnt so much remind me of day as it hinted more towards washingtons effort man on fire the themes are similar you know the act of revenge on the despicable schleps who do harm to the innocent yet equalizer is superior in that antoine fuqua doesnt glorify images of grotesque violence coupled with silly unnecessary subtitles like the late tony scott did he directs with less flash and the results are careful calculated and more efficient just like our hero robert mccall yes this flick is violent and at times denzels special ops character dispatches villains in the style of jason voorhees from the friday the movies im not kidding people but most of the fight scenes are done with minimal lighting so you dont see a ton of blood and gore and to assure you that someone is taking a beating the sound effects with every bone breakthroat slash are louder than they need to be a fuqua trademark when its all said and done this is essentially a thirteen year reunion of a movie featuring director fuqua and his cant miss collaborator in star washington its a serviceable effort despite descending into your standard routine bloody action fare towards its conclusion it works ultimately because of denzel who along with al pacino and liam neeson is up there with being one of my favorite movie stars of all time if you cut his arm hypothetically speaking of course he would literally bleed cool with the exception of kicking every ones butt all over the place in equalizer he actually underplays this performance instead of emoting like a monkey on amphetamines like he did volcanically in training day he instead relies on a natural burning screen presence and a cool walk through a room exuding confidence and some serious swag if you choose to take in a viewing of the equalizer know that of what goes on involves washington doing the whole one man army thing thankfully he separates himself from the pack you know the schwarzeneggers the stallones and the seagals by being a better actor than most action stars exuding some sophistication on eluding or infiltrating the bad guys and essentially showing the audience how the art of being a one man vigilante would realistically go down so for those reasons you should buy a ticket get settled in this fall and wait for the lights to dim after taking in an early matinée the equalizer equaled three stars for me i think youll enjoy it as well,-0.9479,0
Denzel doing what he does best,tags_skeewee,31 December 2014,10,some may say this is a usual denzel movie i agree in part but that doesnt take away that this was an awesome movie yes its predictable but the plot and action makes it ok the movie does a good you in not fully explaining roberts background it was fun trying to guess his background it added to the suspense because just like the bad guys in the movie i wanted to know who was he the action was great not boring at all denzel does a great job playing these type of roles the movie kept me engaged the soundtrack was great the robinhoodninja character was interesting and kept you guessing the special effects were not over the top the last scene when denzel is walking in water coming down and he has that cool killer look as he slowly goes towards the bad guy while shooting him with the nail gun was priceless,0.9912,1
The Fish gotta be the Fish,ferguson-6,28 September 2014,6,greetings again from the darkness while you are likely familiar with slapstick comedy this latest from director antoine fuqua could be described as slapstick action this fits because the implements of destruction include barbed wire a power drill a book hardcover of course a nail gun and even a corkscrew such an unusual assortment takes a bit of edge off the the extremely graphic violence if the kills werent so gruesome we might be tempted to chuckle writer richard wenk adapts the story from the terrific tv series which ran from it starred the late great edward woodward as a classy sophisticated guy who believed in justice for those who needed help against the odds for the movie denzel washington takes over for mr woodward as robert bob mccall the seemingly normal guy with extraordinary skills used to balance the scales mccall lives a quiet life with ocd tendencies he is a friendly guy liked by his coworkers at the home improvement box store imagine clark kent working at home depot and even mentors an overweight hispanic young man in his quest to pass the security guard test mccall is also an insomniac who hangs out after hours reading hemingway at a local diner passing along words of hope and wisdom to an underage prostitute chloe grace moretz none of these people have any idea of mccalls previous career with the company our only glimpse of this is a quick visit to the home of characters from his past played by melissa leo and bill pullman our villains here are the russian mob and its tough to beat that accent for a juicy villain david meunier johnny crowder of justified fame is our first goon followed up by the slick and menacing marton csokas the debt who has an impressive resume of his own it would have been interesting to have more screen time together for csokas and denzel but we understand why thats not practical similar to the bourne movies the good guy always seems to be a step ahead of the bad but that has little impact on our ability to find fun in the action director fuqua provides four or five really stylistic shots including super slomo but also relies on michael baysplosions for one laughable scene at the loading docks another missed opportunity is the score we are slammed with a thumping bass line through much of the movie rather than utilizing the stuart copeland theme from the tv series expect mccall to arrange the flatware just so and continue to dish out justice in at least one sequel,0.9873,1
The best comic book movie of the year,somf,24 September 2014,9,i never saw the television show and i have no doubt that denzels robert mccall character is quite different than the tv show character but he certainly is the best superhero of the year and that is simply what he is antoine fuqua uses close ups of denzels face as he assesses impossible situations and then comes out unscathed usually leaving behind a pile of baddies i was reminded of christian bales batman character in those scenes reviews of the film have been tepid so far mostly citing it as being clichéd and implausible but looking at this like a superhero film elevates it considerably the russian mob characters are the heavily tattooed super villains led by the talented marton csokas the violence is all comic book in its execution with a grand finale that takes place in a home depot type store lets just say denzel gets creative with a host of the stores products in fact the only violence that did not seem comic book like was when the csokas first exams photos of the bodies that were left in mccalls wake and the best news of all is that when the film ends we are left with the feeling that we will be seeing mccall in action again hopefully soon,0.9788,1
Even liberals will like the action.,JohnDeSando,24 September 2014,None,the great and abiding lesson of american history particularly the cold war is that the engine of capitalism the individual is mightier than any collective rand paul hes not the detached jason bourne and hes not the swinging bond but robert mccall denzel washington is tougher than the two a modest home mart employee he has a past no one knows about when asked by some young coworkers he admits to being a pip as in gladys so goes roberts infrequent wit in the exciting the equalizer based on an ancient tv show although he has a limited sense of humor his past working for a federal investigative agency was intense and unusual enough that he went into a protection plan with a new life while visiting a diner straight out of hopper he is a nighthawk he meets very young escort teri chloe grace moretz and spends the rest of the movie revisiting his considerable killing skills to protect her so far nothing new except no romance many clichés and stereotypes especially the russian mobsters and their thugs however denzel brings a quiet competence and compassion to roberts character despite kicking ass every few minutes thus consider the relevance of rand pauls comment introducing this essay about the power of the individual liberals however will enjoy the action with its mixture of caring and retribution interestingly although the equalizer doesnt stray far from the thriller formula the characters are unique enough to enlist your sympathy and we all know from our greek dramas the importance of having sympathy for the hero one of the more fascinating motifs is creative killing wherein at one point the hero uses material in the home improvement building to take out the russians the killing is clean theres little blood and its fun to watch if you enjoy that kind of thing given the heat generated by putin over the ukraine this smart film is prescient about the resurgence of cold war situations and attitudes the cold war isnt thawing it is burning with a deadly heat communism isnt sleeping it is as always plotting scheming working fighting richard nixon,0.9952,1
Denzel still delivers.,realmuthaf,26 September 2014,7,while not being somewhat outstanding the equalizer is still a potent albeit a bit too slowpaced action movie the plot obviously is not very original so the main question was how good it would be executedthe result is mostly satisfying among the strong sides id name of course denzel washington who never disappoints although his other movies ive seen were better gory action and the overall classic action movie feel to it the hero is super badass always walking slowly dispensing kickassery and not looking at explosions while the villain is properly menacing and ruthless the movies not without flaws and shaky camera work during action scenes overly slow pacing and the stereotypical bad guys are among them russian gangsters with cheesy tattoos lots of vodka and tons of kremlin and red square pictures despite that the movie manages to hold its own and be worth your time and money its quite refreshing to watch an oldschool bad assdistributingjustice movie after all those comic book adaptations and the rule denzel doesnt play in bad movies still works,0.3468,1
Best Movie,DominiqueMonroe,3 October 2014,10,this movie was amazing to watch the acting skill level that denzel washington has is remarkable i will train as hard as i possibly can to be in a movie having a supporting role with him hands down my favorite movie thus far the action level this movie has is great from start to finish i was glued to the movie screen i took my parents to see this and we were all very happy with this movie i love this movie so much i will go see at least two more times before it is out of the theaters as an actress i only pray i can and will be as good as denzel and even all the cast in this movie job well done i can only wait until he is presented with another academy award for best male actor,0.9907,1
Washington in Driver's seat,sujanfaster,24 October 2014,7,i love it when old guys do the coming out of the hibernation action movies so i am going to be partial with this review after a loud olympus has fallen fuqua comes out with a bit more subtle action movie this time its not complete popcorn stuff but its a must watch for washingtons fans he occupies almost every frame of the movie no kidding the story is pretty simple but screenplay is well handled the movie might bore the family audience at times but not for long movie is about how a former cia cliché i know operative takes on russian gangsters and the whole mob to save a girl whom he meets at a bar there are some subplots as well to show how our protagonist is a knight in shining armour except he is living in the world where the knights wont exist anymore they add a nice build up to washingtons character and climax antonie fuqua has showed his ability to extract the best from washington again chloe grace mortiz has a significant role but she doesnt get much of the screenspace marton csokas gets to play a russian guy again bill pullman and melissa leo add strength to the star cast there might be a sequel to this movie as there are certain hints regarding the way washigtons character is portrayed in the movie when denzel washington gives a cold stare and says seconds in that voice i am not complaining are you,0.9914,1
My daddy paid so I can write/direct a Hollywood film :),sergiosos77,20 December 2014,1,this movie is so bad that really made me and my gf laugh at many scenes it seems like a years old wrote this it only has clichés all over the film there is no real action and of course the bad guys always miss their shots a vigilante for the dumbass that only wants to see a big explosion and some gunshots you can really know whats coming next and in this case it was all lame clichés about other action movies someone compared this film with die hard yes they even named the good guy with an irish surname theres nothing good in this movie i cannot understand how people give it up to stars ive seen many bad action movies but this is the worst,-0.9305,0
I hope there will be a sequel,searchanddestroy-1,2 October 2014,None,in ordinary circumstances i dont crave for action flicks where super heroes fight against very evil guys with highly expected results but this film is the exception it reminds me many late eighties and early nineties action movies produced by joel silver such as the lethal weapon or die hard series or even last boyscout these were perfectly done absolutely flawless like this one denzel washngton is terrific action sequences astounding and the bad guys outstanding especially the new comer whose i certainly wont forget the face the face to face between him and washington is awesome as i love sooooo much even everything here is predictable it is i repeat so well done in a so professional way film making acting screen writing editing and above all there is not here any silly stupid run of the mill fromance stuff for sissies just touching moments a movie may be poignant without being marsh mallow but there are here some missing sequences such as this one just after the armed robbery at the store where washington works a robbery where the hood takes the female employees ring washington let him go runs to take a big hammer and the scene after he brings the ring back without any explanation you have here some short cuts as this one but i assure you that doesnt reduce the quality of this terrific actionner,0.9875,1
Old School Action,nightwing90,21 November 2014,7,a one man show from denzel washington in the equaliser makes it an engaging action movie even though the film is too predictable and clichéd smart dialogues old and conventional but good doses of action and above all a stylish performance from the academy award winner dw makes this film a watchable one robert mccall who is leading a quiet and peaceful life after retiring as a black ops commando is forced out of his self imposed exile to get back to where he was and what he does best on trying to help his female friend alina who is a sex slave in the hands of her pimp mccall confront and take down the russian mafia single handedly to extract revenge story wise the film has nothing new to showcase but washington deserves full marks to make the film a watchable one through his smart and stylish acting action and dialogue presentation its not that we have action each and every scene but an action mood is created throughout the entire length of the film on the acting side as said earlier its more or less a one man show from denzel washington and he is supported well by a host of other actors especially marton czokas enacting the character of teddy the main henchman of russian mafia don pushkin nice camera work and cuts along with impressive background score too but the vfx had some drawbacks to be specific the bombing scene of undercover building of the gangsters the latter portions have been too stretched and deserved a trimming of ten to fifteen minutes overall here is a money worth old school action and revenge movie for a target audience that serves its purpose and i go with seven out of ten for the equaliser with a sequel in the early planning stages doing the talk its better you get a feel of the movie now and get ready for more thrills,0.9951,1
Denzel Washington is the man!,zer-unleashed,30 September 2014,10,this is my first review i really loved denzel washington in this moviei think he did an outstanding job couldnt think of a better actor than him the way he plays out the roll of this mysterious man who was in his past life a man who eliminated whatever the people above pointed their fingers at is just incredibleyou can actually feel his emotions during the movie as he stares down his enemiesthat grim face indicating he has nothing to loose and intends to finish whatever promise he made to himselfso overall a fantastic set of actors and acting about the movie its a slowpaced action movienothing wrong with that but what it does unlike other slow paced action movies is the way it tells the storyeverything is well connected and flows welland the scenes are just off this worldpeople will say for a one man army he killed his enemies with little to no effortwell ill tell you this the bad guys were shown as really scary no mercy intimidating type of killerstheir presence demanded respecton the other hand robert mccall denzel washingtonwas shown as equally intimidating man skilled to perfection and it really makes you think hard what kind of things he had to do in his past to overcome this new threat overall really a work of art movie slow paced but with memorable action scenes definitely a must watch movie denzel is the man and kudos to his amazing portrayment of a one man army,-0.8997,0
Pretty good,JG934,6 September 2022,7,the movie the equalizer is kind of like a smaller scale john wick with more grounded action the only issue with it being smaller is that the end battle is almost a bit too contained but other than that it works great the idea for denzel washingtons character makes for an entertaining film with him essentially being a one man neighborhood watch that takes justice into his own hands although the action in this film is entertaining and bloody i was left wanting a few more action sequences especially when it came to one of mcalls jobs being done off screen in the end i still enjoyed watching this movie,0.9655,1
Solid Good Film,ty_lattimore2007,29 November 2014,8,equalizer was a bit of an unexpected surprise first i would never bet against denzel i usually enjoy all his films i was on skeptical since antonio fuqua has not really won me over as a director unlike the majority of people i did not like training day therefore i was a bit skeptical of the reteaming of denzel with antonio fortunately i was pleasantly surprised this movie was really good denzel has been on a role lately with his foray into more action oriented films lately he plays the character with such understated poise and humility the hand to hand combat was great the movie has a message but does not hit you over the head with it marton csokas was stunningly evil he is the kind of villain like anthony hopkinsquiet but lethal even when he is not doing anything he just makes your fearful of what he could do i would love if denzel finally gets his own franchise since this could easily have a sequel overall great movie and worth the price of admission perfect casting,0.8855,1

Brand new Denzel,blackmamba99971,6 October 2014,10,a man with a mysterious past as a government agent from a three letter system works in a hardware store only to be confronted by an incident of an acquaintance who had been beaten to near death denzel as always performs with such audacity that you forget he is denzel washington since his days as an operative robert denzel washington has vied to become a recluse from his days as a killer a single man once married brought back into the dim and gritty underground of prostitution money laundering and weaponry where he must hunt down those who wish to do harm against his fellow man with resources from his old agent friends he manages to create a scenario where he can find and observe his targets before making his move from what i can see this film has every element of what is known as the death of humanity to see the russian mobs grow so cold and merciless that they can corrupt even the most decorated police in an instant robert however sees the mob as something the world can do without and he does just that without so much as a bat of an eye lid he takes out single cells or even a central hub just with his hands and what ever is available including a corkscrew from his perspective to see his friends hurt is what gives him the necessary push to get the job done before someone else gets killed in recent years and with certain films to his credit denzel has in a way transformed an ordinary man to becoming a silent hero the equalizer fits the genre a man who has nothing to lose but to gain a bit more freedom to those who desperately need it or want it i like the fact at the end of the movie he is at his computer as he answers an ad about another case who needs help its kind of like the a team yet with one person only roberts skills go way beyond the norm because of his highly trained past so it would befit his nature to becoming that which lends a hand to stop the evil in its tracks i give it ten out ten stars for the action the plot and the music which was sheer genius it was a nice fresh approach without all of the added hiphop rap crap other movies contain for good reason the equalizer creation has given us a glimpse into what is the underground and why those who need help cry out in the face of their own terror denzel has given a great performance again i hope that there is another sequel to this genre what we need now is another hero who doesnt sit too long until it is too late with his obvious talents we can see more of denzels character in the future i hope,0.9891,1
"Very good action movie, bad thriller",The_Hateful_Citizen,27 June 2017,7,in this film antoine fuqua presents us a former cia agent who embarks in a fight against russian pimps robert mccall played by denzel washington is an awesome man arriving has killed men with their own weapons and a corkscrew he is impressed by his mastery of the fight but also and above all by his inhuman cold blood he manages to pierce the skull of a man without flinching the character is very imposing and we attach to it but what caused me problem in this film is why why embark on it just because hes attached to a young prostitute i find it difficult to get there unfortunately this film is still a good action movie but as far as the plot is concerned we will go back it still deserves because the action is very successful very good action movie bad thriller,-0.4118,0
Insanely good movie,insolo,28 September 2014,10,i have dreamed of this movie to be created i have dreamed to see on the big screen a movie as powerful as the equalizer it sucked the last air out of my lungs while watching it and it left me hopefull hope that there will always be someone who cares that there will always be someone who cares enough enough to go out to serve and protect the disadvantaged ones i do hope the tyrants around the globe would watch this movie i cannot imagine something worse that the mighty one breaking the spirit of those less fortunate if someone has power then this power should be used only in service to the others nothing else great acting great fighting scenes great directing it did thrill all my senses it made me think it provoked me in many ways i do not buy movies on dvd but this one will be purchased and played again i saw it yesterday and i am still buzzing all over,0.7422,1
Non-stop action,john32935,16 March 2015,7,i am not a fan of violence in movies especially when done to excess this movie pushes past my normal limit for body count but it is done is such a way ie without much gore that i did not find it gratuitous or offputting additionally denzel washington turns in another stellar performance as a man of violence eg training day among others that the viewer does not mind the extreme willing suspension of disbelief that the director requires mr washingtons character has very little in the way of backstory although his motivation is readily apparent i suspect that some explanatory scenes were cut from the final print since the movie runs long at over hours also i find it difficult to believe that both bill pullman and melissa leo each leading actors in their own right were cast as old friends of mr washingtons character with the original intention that they would have about minutes of combined screen time it seems that these characters would have been the time when the backstory would have been revealed while there is nothing really new in this movie that makes it a mustsee it is wellshot actionpacked and as stated above wellacted thereby earning a viewing recommendation to see more of my other movie reviews please visit,0.8899,1
Russians = Evil!!! Americans = Awesome!,Dill_Doe,21 December 2014,2,seriously this is a film for young kids who still believe in superheroes and fairy tales otherwise you have to be a little dimwitted to actually like to this film let me start off by saying that the film is stylish and had a lot of potential however the scenes and storyline are really awful and quickly bring this film down to the gutter its your typical evil incompetent russians vs the righteous american hero cliché you literally know everything that is about to happen this is all well and good if it was a comedy or arnie film but we are expected to take this film seriously to sum it up lame cliché unoriginal bring your flag and leave your brain at the door when you watch this film,-0.7181,0
The Old Timer Who Masters Time...,ElMaruecan82,29 October 2019,7,what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you the infamous monologue taken from the movie of the same name set a new milestone in action pictures reinventing the vigilante figure with the additional special sets of kills and replacing the crusade against violence by a less highscaled and more personaloriented fight like saving young and vulnerable girls from the claws of male predators and abusing pimps its quite a bold move in an era where damsels in distresses and urban violence have stopped to be popular tropes but i guess this is why it took the talent of versatile and quality actors such as liam neeson or denzel washington to elevate the film about the level of pure machopower exaltation audiences would accept these men as role models rather than regular action movies stars maybe because they bring a dimension of humanity and fatherly warmth not that it lacked in arnie sly or bruce willis but im talking about standards where its not too cool to sound cool anymore as robert mccall washington doesnt replay bryan mills but gives his own depth in a role that could have been rather twodimensional that he made it to finance his fences or make a departure from his awardbaity performances doesnt matter hes quite the man in a performance that isnt too showy even in the showiest parts and youve got to credit the patience antoine fuqua demonstrates in the exposition mccall is the bookworm getting through the top mustread books he works in a home depot shop gets along with his colleagues coaches one of them to lose weight to pass a security job test and befriends a young prostitute played by chloe grace moretz it all builds up to the crucial moment where he makes his mills offer to russian hoodlums who showed that womens welfare wasnt their priority theyre all drowning in vodka and cocky arrogance with every inch of their bodies harboring intimidating skulls and tattoos but naturally no one takes dedushka seriously so the oldtimer has no other choice than teaching them a lesson or two about time efficiency it takes twenty seconds of a nasty fight to make his point but since he aimed for sixteen we get the idea that hes slipping still its the establishing moment weve all waited for the act isnt without consequences and brought the attention to a russian mafia don named vladimir pushkin quite the name who sends his best dragon teddy marton csokas to hunt the killer this is a standard action picture about a man singlehandedly defeating the almighty russian mafia and while the film does find ingenuous ways to avoid the obvious comparisons with taken its the charismatic presence of denzel washington that makes the difference and its not a detail when you have a title that doesnt say much about the film but sound cool enough to make you curious youve got to have a name to press the play button it seems crazy said like this but choosing the right movie to pick on netflix is such a patiencedemanding ordeal that all it takes is a title and a charismatic actor say what you want about denzel washington his movies arent all on the same caliber than malcolm x but he always delivers a memorable performance even in a role that doesnt aim for award and where cinematic excellence consists on dodging caricature and being believable as a skilled fighter and thats the power a few actors can pretend to have something that makes washington equal to clint eastwood his presence is more vital than his words but even eastwood couldnt do without worthy antagonist and washingtons presence is enhanced by a solid villain and maybe thats the aspect that gives the film a slight edge over taken which is that the villain always possesses a special set of skills and doesnt let himself intimidated as well and so we follow a catandmouse chase where the roles are alternatingly reversed and where the chasers become the chased ones and we dont know if the film is as good as the hero or the villain so the film follows a long storyline where we see a lot of fighting some remarkably gruesome that reminded me of a history of violence but even violence can get routinely and the most memorable parts turn out to be the quieter ones which all takes us to a dinner conversation and the closest to a great confrontation the film ever got when mccall confronts teddy to his own past in soviet union the writing is brilliant in fact its so good that the fact that the film chose the safe way and end with a climactic confrontation set in mccalls job area his own comfort zone left me disappointed it seems that fuqua wasnt so confident about his material that he thought he had to keep on the track and makes the violence an escalating process but think of a film like first blood once we know that rambo is a man not to mess with the film surprises us with the heartbreaking vietnam monologue revealing a hidden depth in rambos personality i wish equalizer could find a way to take us offguard its a sign of lack of maturity when a film doesnt try to surprise you even a film like taken chose to have a shocking moment where mills mission proved not to be a complete success but in equalizer even when mccalls friends and colleagues are taken as hostages its hard to believe that none of them was killed just to make a point so either the bad guys underestimate mccall to the end or act dumber than they should or get too soft its almost offcharacter i guess it makes the fiim as good as the hero after all,-0.9094,0
""" I am offering you a chance to do the right thing. Take it.""",jan_kalina,9 October 2014,10,denzel washington always grabs the chance to play an amazing character or to simply be in an amazing film its the denzel guarantee that if he is starring in it then in no way you are about to watch a bad film frankly i have to say how surprised i was at the level of violence in this film meaning it is quite violent i didnt expect that at alli expected the usual routine but this film is rrated so you enjoy all the blood you want denzel washington is the reason to see this film he never disappoints chloe grace moretz is amazing as always but she has a very limited screen time marton csokas as the russian fixer stands out as the most surprising actor in the bunch he is intimidating scary and well russian his character poses a great threat to our hero as violent this film is it also has quite inventive action in the finale mccall uses any tool that can come in handy and he does so in quite a few unexpected ways antoine fuqua and denzel washington made great in training day this time it is even better more perfect film these roles of quiet men who decided to right the wrong in the world suit washington the best if you want believable characters attentiongrabbing story then this is the film to go,0.978,1
Recommendable.,dasa108,3 November 2022,7,this film offers us the umpteenth version of someone who is capable of defeating an army under cover of the most trivial objective to avenge the fate of a prostitute whose luck disappeared knowing that we have seen the idea of the film a thousand times the key is to try to see the outstanding elements fortunately for us we found a few a good performance by denzel washington and the main villain very well edited sequences where violence prevails with all its shocking beauty an attention to detail direction and the good fortune of presenting the villains as absolutely despicable beings although not many innocents die the bad ones generate rejection and desire for an atrocious death the film satisfies that primal desire with elegance recommendable,0.3883,1
The Equalizer,rcr1608,4 October 2014,10,we went to see the new denzel washington movie the equalizer i really think he is such a nice man he has fame fortune and looks but he didnt let it turn him into a jerk instead he tries to be a good influence on kids he doesnt curse in his movies in this newest movie he asked some guys who were cursing why do you curse so much they didnt know how to respond to that this movie is about him helping some kids get a better life i like how only the bad guys curse in his movies and you dont see them very much but he is setting an example to kids who like his movies cursing makes you look like a bad guy he also encouraged kids to read in this movie i like the movies he chooses to do i also like déjà vi and much ado about nothing im sure he has others that have just slipped my mind right now but these three are really nice,0.9859,1

The vigilante Denzel never disappoints!,M4XB0X,13 November 2023,9,here is the usual denzel washington taking charge of a character of a discreet but not too refined plot and making it a semimasterpiece certainly an engaging and adrenalinefilled film the events that revolve around robert mccall denzel are full of violence exploitation and crime destined to crash against this exmilitary man with absolutely unique abilities the double register on which the film flows sees a person with kind and refined manners transform into a ruthless and infallible killer determined to help those in need in this case a young prostitute the characterization of the bad guys contrasted by roberts exploits makes the film truly exciting and nontrivial even if as i was saying the plot is not the most original i liked it a lot and as often happens the first in the series is preferable to the sequels which are pleasant but predictable great movie great character,0.9576,1
Guts Over Fear,ThomasDrufke,26 January 2015,7,at years old denzel washington is still one of the best action stars on the planet can we get a denzel vs liam neeson film already or perhaps even a team up film i believe they are both in their s now so the clock is ticking the equalizer is a pure action film much like taken the story takes a bit of a backseat to the insane action sequences but when you get a film as entertaining as this one thats quite alright washington plays a retired agent of some sorts who swears to not go back to his old roots and stay clean it all changes when he sees teri chloe grace moretz a teenage prostitute being abused the premise is very similar to taken but i think the payoff for this film isnt as high as taken moretz slips out of the film for the better part of hours it becomes more of a revenge film without exemplifying the reason behind the revenge well enough i will say that the action is twice as good but also overthetop as taken robert washington kills people in the most unnecessarily strange ways but its awesome it has all the clichés of a action thriller but yet it works it also helps that every explosion robert walks away from theres a great score to compliment it the film is pretty long for not having a lot of depth to the story but it still has a great amount of rewatchability there arent many memorable characters or even people you care about besides denzel if they end up making a franchise out of it i hope they add depth to the characters and bulk up the supporting cast ridiculously fun action denzel is still a bada catchy musicscore seen the story before no depth to the characters,0.9943,1
A retired agent seeking to right the wrongs on the innocent has to face off with a ruthless henchman sent by the Russian mafia.,pal05052003,3 February 2015,8,any action movie with denzel washington is good nowadays but his one stands out the tone and mood is grim and resembles that of the bourne series even the background music reminds me of the bourne series however it may hint of the bourne series it is definitely not a ripoff washingtons mccall is a worldweary former agent who still hinted through the books he reads seeing a young girl chloe moretz brutalized by a crime boss he ends up wreaking revenge and finally takes on the whole russian mob as a conflicted hero who has to choose between living a quiet life and accepting his roots as a killer washington is perfect for the role his ruggedness and charisma makes him believable as both a nice guy who can kill chloe moretz once again reminds us how talented she is in all her roles she is a totally different personality i even forgot that she used to be hit girl in kick ass or carrie white moretzs performance as a hooker with childlike innocence is enough to make anyone feel like wanting to help thus it is easy to believe why washingtons character spurred to action as for another great performance in the movie marton csokas plays the henchman out to get washingtons mccall csokas is the perfect foil he is intelligent and charismatic but is ruthless and amoral he shines in this movie in fact he is much scarier than when he played a treadstone assassin in the bourne supremacy and that says a lot another great thing about the movie is the soundtrack it fits the narrative and tone perfectly all in all a great action thriller to enjoy,0.9928,1
Denzel being brilliant - a very good film,HelenMary,20 February 2017,6,i remember seeing the equaliser the tv show when i was young staring edward woodward this is the same but totally different denzel plays robert bob mccall and we see him initially start his days in simplicity in a mundane job in a simple home reading not sleeping and enjoying quiet solitude and routine the pace of the film can be described the same way quiet solitude and routine nothing happens loudly or quickly and you have to pay attention denzel is at his charming best think training day think safe house and magnificent seven with the charm of the prince in much ado about nothing antoine fuqua director also working with denzel on training day and magnificent seven is flawless seamless and deeply committed to a viewing experience that immerses the viewer often more often than not lighting is low in the equalizer and little is said or explained what happens in the dark is salient but not narrated this makes for a slow burning piece of great cinema tension and pressure mount and you feel it like john wick keanu reeves as baba yaga the bogeyman washingtons dealings with russian mob are equally devastating accomplished and quiet watching the film you dont know who robert mccall is just the guy in the diner reading through the list of books before you die incidentally im shamefully only on and making tentative friends with alina or teri brilliantly played by kick ass star chloe grace moretz the young prostitute you dont know who he is but that is drip fed to you through the film unlike other heroes mccall doesnt do what he does for glory or recognition he does it for justice and moral right you dont hear teris story either which is a blessing but not having backstories and motivations narrated is a clever ploy for you to fill in your own blanks or keep the pace quiet and slow moretz and washingtons friendship is lovely and believable he is a trustworthy person and like his unobtrusive violence righting wrongs you dont see sexual violence in this film either the awful things teri has to endure are not spelled out which is a relief less is more martin csokas a good actor but known for his hammy portrayal and terribly overdone russian accent in xxx was perfectly cast here he too played it understated and deadly with the confidence or someone who has never been realistically challenged before possibly drawing on his experience of playing celeborn in lotr quiet graceful and deadly when i say unobtrusive violence meaning you dont always see it sometimes you do this is not a film for under by any stretch of the imagination theres some very up close uses for common household items put to alternative use in the film if you are a bit squeamish or sensitive dont watch that said fugua uses darkness and suggestion well even in these scenes everyone in the cast put in performances to be proud of but washington of course was the stand out he truly is a phenomenal performer whatever he touches is golden and i very much like seeing age and experience and economy of violent movement showing professionalism and realism over glamour and youth and showy unrealistic fight scenes any day especially with denzel marton csokas known for his terrible russian accent and hammy acting in xxx is infinitely more formidable as a russian mob fixer here,0.9983,1
Denzel is fine but the movie disappoints,abisio,14 December 2014,2,if it was not a denzel washington movie it could easily pass for b direct to video movie low production values not outstanding characters or actors aside from denzel and little used cloe moretz a quite predictable and lazy written story several usa politically correct details spoiler follow denzel never kills a cop end of spoiler this is a movie denzel can do it while sleeps and he is really good but it is not a good movie by far too long for his own good and cheap special effects uninteresting final showdown antoine fuqua made the mid budget olympus has fallen last year and the looked far more expensive that this one which reportedly cost over in brief if you are a fan of denzel get training day this one is not worth the over two hours spent,0.9163,1

Tour De Force,refinedsugar,1 November 2023,8,this is the modern day blueprint from which i hope more action films will follow suit an interesting main character good villains good action great tone throughout and a wickedly awesome musical score that sets the stage to me the equalizer is all of that you get quite a few known faces in the cast and they really showed up robert mccall denzel washington looks and seems like an average everyday joe but dont judge this book by its cover he was once a highly skilled exmilitary man knee deep in the intelligence business whos thought to be dead and has put that life behind him that is until alina chloe grace moretz an acquittance that he always runs into converses with at an all night diner gets roughed by and put into the hospital by her russian organized crime bosses pimps so sets in motion this mans quest for justice which has far and wide implications he has to battle formidable exspetsnaz nicolai teddy rensen itchenko marton csokas his cut throat mercs a dirty boston detective frank masters david harbour and ultimately the head of the snake ultra rich ultra powerful russian mobster vladimir pushkin vladimir kulich firing on all cylinders the equalizer is a picture coming together in perfect synergy to be something better than it should theres a great balance of action and heart but everything feels lean thin with very little fat they do a great job of progressively amping up the action while showing mccall as a real human being caring and helping people out without going overboard the directing from antoine fuqua is solid i put it in the wheelhouse right alongside his best films shooter training day denzel washington came ready and the script gives him the playground to do so best of all marton csokas is really memorable hes got a lot of fun moments through action or dialog and feels fleshed out to be something more than the usual one note presences we usually get in flicks like these enough cant be said of david harbour chloe grace moretz too david just shines in his role and tangos well with both the material denzel while chloe makes her characters bond heartful which is important when its the catalyst for starting the whole adventure off on its not some manufactured fakeness thats used for a point and then discarded melissa leo bill pullman also put in decent bit roles lastly the musical score from harry gregson williams and some licensed tracks pay dividends in helping to establish the tone they were going for the equalizer is as good as big budget action films get these days in my honest opinion containing all the necessary ingredients to entertain but not stopping there to go a step or two further and provide some layers i wouldnt argue with anyone who says its not new ground yes its not original at all but its a killer fun time that im always down to watch,0.9975,1
""" when you look at me what do you see?",deleyshaun,4 March 2024,7,the equaliser tells the story of a man with exquisite killing and survival skills washington with a mysterious past he uses this for good helping a girl grace moretz who is caught up with the russian mob when members are killed by washington the head calls on enforcer csokas to clean up the mess this leads to an eventual showdown between the two the cat and mouse game between them is what elevates this film considerably both men have their own philosophy and this is fleshed out thoroughly although you now how its going to end csokas is a formidable villain and very much matches washington which is saying something the brilliant restaurant scene is reminiscent of deniro pacino in heat although the graphic kills require some suspension of belief it is fresh being the first instalment and quite enjoyable the support actors are also good gracemoretz harbour leo and pullman but they wont make you forget csokas and washington recommended viewing,0.7029,1
Reinvention,carlwilkessob,31 December 2023,8,edward woodwards television series of this was fantastic viewing as a kid this reinvention by denzel washington is superb very sinister and well played russian bad guys which sets up a very tense thriller almost in the same vein as taken the way robert macall deals with his enemies is so disturbing yet entertaining i would argue this is one of washingtons better movies and is probably the reason it is the only of his to produce a sequel so far part has just come out so i am rewatching the first two to prepare for it if the first is anything to go by they will be great well worth watching,0.79,1
"Et tu, Denzel?",zzzman69,5 January 2015,None,i am writing this review just to do what i can in my small way to lower the viewer rating for this movie if that is what it was i can only speculate that the majority of viewers saw another movie certainly not the one that i tried to watch i did not stay to the end but that is because the older i get the less inclined i am to torture myself i simply refuse to believe that somewhere in this country that there are not writers who could actually write a screenplay for denzel washington that would at least rise to the level of mediocrity the writing in this movie could only have been dreamed up by a social deviant during a root canal it scares me to think that anyone around me might find such violent moronic tripe to be entertainment the only saving grace is that apparently it only takes one excia agent to dismantle the best that russian mobsters can throw at him and boy did they try to go usa,-0.8689,0
Nice acting but a bit confused on the character build up,Seraphion,3 October 2014,6,mccall looks like a normal man who works at a home diy supply store helping coworkers and leading a routine life he does also have peculiar habits of bringing supplies of his own even when dining at his frequent diner there he meets teri a girl hooked onto some nasty men standing idle when seeing teri being picked up forcefully mccall takes action after one night he finds her beaten up badly mccall quickly dispatches five russian mobsters when a deal for teri whose real name is alina goes sour the mafia boss in moscow sends in teddy his ex spetznas henchman to track the killer meanwhile mccall lies low after the incident but it turns out that his own sense of justice is rekindled secretly exacting vengeance toughly and often violently those who he encounters while being wronged his actions soon lead him to focus on disrupting the new york branch of the russian mafias operation teddy finally catches up to him after escaping several of teddys attempts on his life mccall contacts his old colleagues in the cia for info on teddy it turns out that mccall was an elite black ops operative who faked his own death in exchange for a quiet life with his new info mccall plans to take out the russian mafia kingpin pushkin but teddy finds mccalls weakness those he cares about he then takes mccalls coworkers as hostages to reel him in mccall tactically dispatches teddy and his men without having any conventional weapon he then finishes his plan on pushkin making it to look like an accident after that mccall receives many emails asking for help on similar cases the story kind of opens weakly focusing on the mystery of the main characters background and building on the peculiar things he does this approach kind of loses its relevance when out of a sudden mccall launches on his slow motion weakness analysis scene if not for the promotion as a action movie and the tv series background not many viewers will get the connection between mccall and his ability here also the slow motion analysis thing is nothing new as we can have a better and more entertaining version in robert downey jrs sherlock holmes movies they are more detailed with all those commentaries on them again having the main characters background not developed adequately feels quite strange to those who watch this movie without knowing beforehand the movies background as based on a tv series this feels strange because the movie has so many places to put hints and minor details that could subtly point mccalls background out well at least the story unravels itself very much predictably that means theres nothing unpredictable with this movie no surprising plot twist nor a grand finale theres even a poorly done story deviation on the sequence of teddys brush with the irish which doesnt really contribute anything to the greater picture yet the story nicely depicts a black ops supposedly uncanny resourcefulness in using mostly everyday items for combat or even medical purposes the action bits are quite sufficient for my expectations you cant really expect aging stars as denzel washington to have action scenes with a lot of heavy motions here and there antoine fuqua compensates this by using closer takes on the action scenes particularly on the fighting parts there is also not much running or any other classic action moves such as duckandroll the acting feels nice in overall denzel washington really can act out any kind of character you throw him his calm composure really depicts what we expect from an experienced elite black ops guy especially if we compare his role here to his other more talkative roles such as in training day or the taking of pelham marton csokas is very much at home with this kind of role as his similar role in xxx alongside vin diesel was his first big break chloegrace moretz second performance this year makes this movie better here she shows that she can take on the varied nature of characters my final word for the equalizer is that this movie deserves just a mere out of score a recommendation is quite a soso decision honestly its quite entertaining as a movie but all the predictability of the story and the notsosolid character building has left some damage to the overall presentation,-0.8052,0
Bravo Denzel,pensman,26 July 2015,8,of course we have seen this film before except for a few unique film dramas most of us like the familiar of new wine in old bottles recently liam neeson has turned the revenge flic into a minor cottage industry and charles bronson did fine with death wish denzel washington now gets a turn updating the old edward woodward tv series and he does a nice job the bad guys are bad and unless you are a bad guy youre going to cheer as this robert mccall evens the scores no doubt we might like some additional back story but im in no rush im willing to wait for a second film for additional info for this one just sit back and watch this new don quixote tilt at russian windmills there are some nice performances here by bill pullman melissa leo and for me newcomer johnny skourtis and marton csokas plays the villain we use to hiss at during the saturday matinees lets hope we get at least a trilogy out of this run,-0.3262,0
Home hardware aware,sergelamarche,3 November 2023,7,denzel does a great job being the hero with a conscience a deadly hero with some ocd and good knowledge of weapons and home hardware he is some sort of jack ryan operative in retirement that cant resist action yes this type of film is done over and over this one seems less prearranged and even awkward at the beginning the flow is consistent and accelerates with some pauses that makes sense all the characters are human except some vilains obviously psychopathic i was expecting the regular shoot them up so i was pleasantly surprised by the level of acting and the story of it all good work,0.938,1
Really well done,talllwoood13,16 November 2023,8,ive been watching a lot of action movies lately and thought this one would be just ok i remember hearing about the infamous nail gun scene but it really worked the writing was witty when it needed to be the characters were well cast none of this woke nonsense and denzel was perfect for the lead the ending kind of worked but i feel they could have done a bit better in those last few minutes but either way this is a fun movie to watch certainly the hardware store aspect of it made this stand out from the many movies similar to this if youre into movies like rambo john wick under seige or maybe a bit of a stretch die hard youll enjoy this im certainly watching this again,0.9645,1
the quiet exterminator,dromasca,23 November 2014,7,robert mccall denzel washington should be a superhero after all only a superhero can destroy in seconds the us east coast command center of the russian mafia actually exceeding by seconds his plans can survive an army of armed and dangerous enemies in a home depot even saving the lives of all his good friends and then take a flight to russia to destroy the whole organizations brains in the vipers nest it is actually the antihero vision of the character that gives this story a high dose of credibility yes i am incredulous of having said it denzels character building is so rigorous so precise so human that he not only builds himself as the positive character we as viewers can sympathize with but also lightens the whole story which otherwise would be a brutal encounter between yet another retired agent and the world which would not let him enjoy his quiet reading and lattes at night hours a world full of violence of human traffic of ladies in distress silently shouting for help with nobody to hear but hollywood superheroes director antoine fuqua seems to make amends to me for olympus has fallen which i liked much less for various reasons i would have liked chloe grace moretz to be more on screen but her absence for much of the screen time after having been the trigger of the story has logic the equalizer is based on a tv series from the which i did not see or maybe i forgot but there is enough good material in this film including mystery hints about robert mccalls past including a tragically lost love to make me hope that this is another start of a series on big screen this time,-0.65,0
Denzel Washington has been in a lot of Good Movies - this is not one of them,mfredenburg,21 October 2014,3,denzel washington has been in a lot of good movies unfortunately this is not one of them having appreciated the mid s series upon which this movie is loosely based and liking denzel washington as an actor i went to this movie feeling that the movie had a better than fair chance of being a good action thriller the movie starts promisingly as we see robert mccalls denzels efforts to positively impact those with whom he works and socializes unfortunately the movie goes downhill from there while good guys killing bunches of villains and being unrealistically lucky is standard fare for mindless action films the initial minutes plus of this film tried so hard to convince us that this was not going to be such a film that the transition to being a mindless action flick is jarring and disappointing sadly once robert mccall begins his killing spree it truly does become a mindless action film that is largely without suspense or fun the lack of fun comes from washingtons character who despite very token almost meaningless efforts to give the bad guys a chance to do the right thing clearly enjoys figuring out all sorts of ways to kill them of course only bad guys use guns but highly trained ex cia operativesassassins like robert mccall eschew guns so ex cia operative robert mccall does the competent professional thing by leaving guns on the ground throughout movie instead choosing to kill the villains using a wide variety of methods that in real life would have put himself and the people he is supposed to be protecting at far greater risk as described above the situations robert puts himself and the risky way in which he engages the bad guys completely contradicts the idea that he truly is this methodical experienced professional that he manages to come out ahead could only have been accomplished by script writers with no regard for realism or the viewers sense of credulity the situations were so stupid that even i watched the film i found myself angry with the scriptwriters for being so obviously lazy frustratingly washingtons character does not even do a good job protecting the innocent putting them at risk even after being directly warned they will be put at risk by his actions in the end this was a poorly made film not because it featured the hero doing ridiculously unrealistic things but because the movie worked hard at the beginning to tell us this was not going to be mindless action flick but than went on to deliver a mindless action flick that really was no fun at all,-0.9944,0
"The Good, the bad and the Ugly",quasides,17 December 2014,6,this movie has it all the good denzel whashington great presents just a few more lines and a slower backstory would have been nice he is doing a great job the sound is great too mix well with the style of that film the filming was very good too very stylish cool almost understated the used cgi blend in well isnt to much overstated this aspect was done right little spoilers ahead i keep em down i promise the bad the storyline it doesnt make any sense why after he decided to start his war also a lot of other people not related to the mob crossing his path in a bloody way also nobody seems to bother afterward he still can visit his old café living in the same neighborhood nobody specially not the police cares much also the action of the russian mobster who came to investigate doesnt make any sense all his actions where for no reason and no purpose also the jumps and almost fast tracks of short story lines made no sense less would have been more more slow calm backstory about his personality and life less small action plot and more logic would have been appreciated also the complete absence how he is doing his secret spy work isnt really satisfying he is working like a ghost not only to the enemy but also the the audience this give the movie a certain character but sadly it was replaced by dull action sequences the ugly the fighting scenes some of them its laughable how those mobster with their equipment even go into a fight they acted like some lemmings in the game not like some ex military mobster muscles and why again was the mobster hunting the security guard more spoilers also if someone get shot in his shoulder you can really fight with it after you can simply burn it to close it and keep going there are broken bones there is a projectile that he is fixing himself under a shelf while exspeznatz with nightvision looking for him well sorry that was too much the worst action sequence where that nail pistol can shoot over yards penetrate didnt he have a bullet resistant west a hole body and go trough bottom line this movie has its moments and is often beautiful to watch but again and again bad writers ruined it there would have been potential but it wasnt used its still very good watchable only for dencel himself,-0.9547,0
Absolutely Amazing,Kjvm5757,5 October 2014,10,every minute of this action packed movie is amazing this is the single best movie i have ever seen all of the actors do great jobs at their roles from the villains to the side characters they all give convincing performances denzel washington proved that he is the best actor of all time with his great performance in this masterpiece the plot makes sense and is not contrived at all there are no loose strings or plot holes making this movie very well thought out the music in this movie is some of the best i have ever heard i will definitely be purchasing the soundtrack if one is ever made for this movie the movie does a great job of making all of the characters seem important to the audience and has denzel feel like the greatest vigilante of all time you must see this movie as soon as possible everything about this movie is great overall the best movie of and possibly the best movie of all time,0.9952,1
"Overall OK, Nothing GREAT!",sureshwhitelight,2 October 2014,6,denzel washington has done pretty good quality movies before this is definitely not one of those it is a normal action movie with a weak story line it has some good scenes but the justifications for the story were missing denzel never failed to deliver in any of the scenes but that was not enough to make this movie great other characters in the movie didnt have much role to play as this was a one man show the bad guys introduction was good and his role lost the pace later very little effort was made to make the viewers believe why someone would go to such an extent to play god could have used a little more humor to keep the audience entertained denzels fans can watch it without getting bored others watch in when the dvd comes,0.9743,1
Denzel Delivers!!!,zardoz-13,29 September 2014,8,although he neither dons a mask nor fires silver bullets denzel washington does virtually everything else that the lone ranger would in the columbia pictures bigscreen adaptation of the vintage television crime series the equalizer for the record cbstv aired episodes of the equalizer between and acclaimed british actor edward woodward of becket fame toplined this hourlong dramatic series as robert mccall a good samaritan vigilante who strode the mean streets of new york city as a former operative with an enigmatic government espionage agency mccall applied his skills both as a sleuth and a shadow to help desperate people who could turn to nobody else in their hour of hardship bespectacled sophisticated and erudite mccall relied on his brains more often than his brawn nevertheless he could surprise his adversaries with swift physical action when required best of all mccall never charged his woebegone clients a cent for his services now a quarter of a century later training day director antoine fuqua and expendables scenarist robert wenk have appropriated only the characters name and the shows basic premise nevertheless the equalizer is a pretty exciting saga unlike woodwards mccall who was a widower with a son washingtons mccall is a widower who works at a home depot sort of emporium in adapting the series fuqua and wenk have fashioned an aboveaverage suspenseful but wholly outlandish crime thriller that takes mccall back to square one after he left the agency under mysterious circumstances but before he established his altruistic private eye business as much as i loved the television series i think fuqua and wenk have done a splendid job of reshaping it to accommodate twotime oscar winning actor denzel washington who played reasonably similar characters in both man on fire and safe house after a car bomb nearly claimed his life while working for an inscrutable government outfit robert mccall denzel washington has retired to the relative obscurity of boston massachusetts everybody knows him now as a jovial hardworking mega home mart store employee mccall prefers to immerse himself in a good novel at a nearby diner that artist edward hopper could easily have immortalized on canvas indeed the quiet and unobtrusive mccall lives a simple life without anybody to clutter it up until he befriends a naive year hooker teri chloë grace moretz who hangs out at the same diner when he reads teri is not a conventional hooker but prostitute who works for the local russian mafia eventually she offends these brutal dastards that possess all the subtlety of grizzly bears gets badly beaten up and lands in the local hospital mccall is swift to retaliate he dispatches five tough guys as easily as if he were stomping cockroaches typically before he goes into action our hero sets the stop watch and then checks it afterward when he isnt intervening on terris behalf mccall helps an obese hispanic coworker ralphie johnny skourtis achieve his dream of becoming a security guard poor ralphie eats all the wrong foods and lacks discipline until mccall coaches him and transforms the affable oaf when ralphie has to quit his home mart job to help out his mother newcomer luz sanchez who is being preyed on at her restaurant by corrupt boston cops mccall not only helps them clean up their store but also straightens out the dirty detectives who were extorting cash from her as well as other business owners naturally since fuqua and wenk want us to feel sympathetic toward mccall they pit him against the most psychopathic mob enforcer on the planet teddy marton csokas appears to be a fastidious dapper and inoffensive fellow who utters each syllable of each word with hopelessly precise clarity when he arrives in boston the local corrupt cops treat him as if he were a sissy it doesnt take them long to learn that he is far from effeminate teddy behaves like an efficiency expert as he launches his investigation to see who had the audacity to kill five members of his mob boston detective masters david harbour of the green hornet escorts him to a rendezvous with the local irish mob boss little john looney shawn fitzgibbon of mystic river who displays nothing but contempt for the russians by the time teddy has smashed little john to a bloody pulp masters has had to gun down both of looneys heavilyarmed henchmen teddy scrutinizes anybody who entered the bar where the five russian gangsters died and kills at least one person who lies to him about the people involved in the incident eventually he figures out by studying surveillance camera footage that robert mccall is the most likely suspect as ruthlessly murderous as he is teddy isnt prepared to tangle with a man like mccall who is far more merciless director antoine fuqua is no stranger to action thrillers his credits include the replacement killers bait shooter tears of the sun training day brooklyns finest and olympus has fallen he stages with style to spare each combat sequence and he must have relished guy richies sherlock holmes movies because he imitates the way that sherlock inventoried his adversaries when mccall appraises the russian mobsters some of mccalls weapons including the power drill and the nailgun have been used before in lethal weapon and the driller killer rated r for strong bloody violence and language including some sexual references the equalizer isnt as gory as it could have been nevertheless fuqua delivers several memorable action scenes and washington is so charismatic you will stand up and cheer as he whittles down the villains marton coskas qualifies as a truly creepy villain too clocking in at minutes the equalizer takes its time leisurely building up to its bulletriddled tarantinostyle climax by the time he has exacted vengeance on these homicidal fiends mccall emerges as a largerthanlife power who could scare the grim reaper,-0.988,0
Watching The Equalizer is almost like watching the Iraq War.,khanbaliq2,29 October 2014,6,the equalizer is one very brutal film theres hardly any humor in it and at times its violent in the extreme its definitely not something that you should watch with your girlfriend because it deals with prostitution corruption murder loss and the underworld if the equalizer didnt contain any action it would have been a truly depressing and unpleasant viewing experience i guess the only reason to see this film is denzel washington who plays robert mccall one can think of the equalizer as a superhero movie because of its break with reality and mccalls ability to kill people in impressive and often ridiculous ways mccall also has a knack for avoiding injury and he deals with the bad guys mostly at night there are attempts in richard wenks screenplay to develop the characters but they dont go far and the result is a simple fight of good against evil the mobsters are mostly clichés their victims are clichés and the only thing that mccall has to decide is whether or not he should again become the unstoppable killing machine that he was before the gruesome and violent action scenes manage to entertain because of washingtons slowburn perfectly modulated performance its just shootouts and fights theres nothing new or original about them even if they are expertly staged as the film moves along it gets more and more ridiculous going from mccall wanting to help a brutalized girl chloe grace moretz to mccall taking on almost the whole mafia underworld foreign and domestic the equalizer is no lethal weapon or die hard its more like death wish the film isnt really entertaining but it can be compelling especially when the mobsters try to find mccall and take him down i dont recommend the equalizer because its not much of a thriller and its not much of an action movie it has its moments but its predictable brutal and mostly forgettable,-0.9952,0

Denzel Washington + Antonio Fuqua = box office success.,ironhorse_iv,9 October 2014,8,what do you see when you look at me quotes the tag line of this movie directed by antonio fuqua i have to say when i look at this movie its really good but so formulaic it has a lot of tiresome clichés and tropes that you see in a lot in a denzel washington movie the movie isnt anything new to denzel washington this film has almost the same similar plotline of s man on fire it has the outsmart skills and tactics that you would see in a movie like s safe house the movie is also a bit onedimensional black and white as it comes with characters bad guys are just really bad the victims are just victims and not playing mind games or twisting the truth to get their way dont expend any twist and turns in this film its just a generic action film i really dont know how accurate it was to the tv show with the same name but by the looks of it it really doesnt match well where was control during all this where was the jaguar xj its look nearly nothing like the show in this version of the equalizer a mysterious man named robert mccall denzel washington is trying to live a normal quiet life but when he meets a young prostitute name teri chloë grace moretz in the need of help he cant stand idly by and take control by taking on the whole ultraviolent russian mob denzel washingtons character must had the godlike superman codes because it seem really it always seem like he was one step further than the bad boys the bad boys never had a chance the movie really borderline unrealistic when mccall rarely shows any weakness it seems that he always have the unlimited resources to combat everything that the russian mob can dish on him not once could i see his character honestly dying its really felt onesided the movie is full of violent imagery and clever way to kill people i do like slowmotion sequences meant to imitate roberts timedprecision combat style it does remind me so much of sherlock holmes too bad half of the ending action sequence is in pitch dark making it hard to see its also go way too long this movie is really long despite clocking in hrs minutes there are tons of dead shots pacing where nothing is going on it doesnt use the time wisely a lot of the robert mccalls backstory is vague thin and poorly developed over the course of the movie the movie doesnt even show if mccall suffer from ocd or not mad props for denzel washington for adding some depth in the character anyways crimes come and go in the film in an oddly forced simultaneously way it felt more like a series of tv episodes oddly put together than a movie the whole robbery in the home mart should had been in the beginning than in the middle of the film chloe grace moretz while getting third billing is barely in the film she is in the majority of the first half and doesnt appear back until the end instead mccall is supported by subplots like ralph johnny skourtis a fellow employee at the home mart where mccall works at trying to become a security guard characters like brian plummer bill pullman susan plummer melissa leo particular showing up has with little to do besides exposition it felt like those scenes would had been cut the villain despite being over the top monotone speaking evil russians stereotypes were alright marton csokas as teddy the russian mob enforcer is fittingly nightmarish with a combination of meticulous control and savage brutality he is wildly unpredictable and totally compelling for the most part all the acting in this film were alright the movie has a lot of metaphor storytelling that really dont match with the story within the story old man and the sea by ernest hemingway tells the story of honor in struggle defeat and death the old man santiago is characterized as someone struggling against defeat santiago though destroyed at the end of the novella that his fish is eaten by the sharks is never truly defeated the film would be more powerful if characters that mccall care for were killed not once did mccall lost any of his closefriends or felt like he got close to being defeated the movie lose a bit of that i do hope they make the film sequels a little bit more challenging so it can stand out more the movie does have a pretty good soundtrack that was great to listen throughout the film overall its not a bad movie its pretty damn good i just wish for more,-0.9679,0
Denzel delivers the goods,knights_01,13 October 2014,7,denzel washington delivers as ex cia operative robert mccall who routinely goes about his business in downtown boston with a little ocd thrown in for good measure robert promised his recently deceased wife that he would move on from his former life and that was all going well until he befriends terialina a very underused chloe moretz who is on the receiving end of some harsh treatment from her russian pimp now this is an action movie it isnt pretending to be anything else so dont go in expecting some deep and meaningful character development scenarios this is denzel handing out justice in his own way as robert mccall decides to help chloe out by taking out the local russian mafia after trying to buy alinas freedom this doesnt sit well with the russians and soon teddy marton csokas arrives to try to figure out what went wrong from this point in your belief needs to be subdued a bit as robert appears to always be one step ahead of teddy and his band of local goons including the clichéd dirty cops even though the movie has a number of action checkpoints we the viewer need to pass show me an action movie that doesnt i found myself buckled in for the ride what i think could hurt this movie is the fact that denzel is teaming up with training day director antoine fuqua and we all know that was a successful partnership back in my advice be prepared to suspend a little bit of belief and just sit back and enjoy the ride and who knows maybe robert might be back to help someone else,0.9532,1
The greatest action film in a very long time,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,19 July 2015,10,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning robert mccall denzel washington was an ex cia operative with a lethal set of skills who quietly left the agency and settled in to a quiet life working for a home department store but when he strikes up a friendship with teri chloe grace moretz a young girl aspiring to be a musician but entrapped to some vicious gangsters he finds himself forced to employ the skills from his past life once again setting him on a collision course with teddy marton csokas the gangsters brutally efficient enforcer adapting an old tv show from the seems to be the norm these days which on the surface doesnt offer much in the way of surprise or even excitement in the equalizers way but left in the right hands for a change everythings come off a treat and the result is a solid effective action adventure that evokes great memories from the good old days when action was at its height over ten years after training day denzel and director antoine fuqua have reunited and recreated that hardhitting superb magic once again only this time with washington in the hero role and how finely he fits it too perfectly fitting the character and suiting his physical requirements down to a tee he is matched by csokas as the bad guy the best in a long while eerily menacing methodical and suddenly shocking with his unassuming moments of enraged violence unlike many modern directors fuqua is not brash and allows his story to take its time and progress at its own pace with a proper beginning middle and end stretching at over two hours but never weary or dull and culminating with one of the best action sequences in a long while with a home department store being turned in to a battleground with a selection of diy equipment not really being used for their intended purpose the names involved should have got my senses buzzing more than they already did but thankfully i was not disappointed this is just the best action film in years brutally violent intelligently written well directed and polished with a slick veneer its good that its taken so long to getting round to writing the review as its given me more time to rave about it as much as i should and give it the justice it deserves,0.9955,1
6.5/10,Giacomo_De_Bello,15 October 2014,6,forget originality forget emotional depth forget interesting storytelling and you will have the same fun i had in the theater with the equalizer its pretty obvious that i wasnt going in expecting an oscar contender i just wanted to see denzel be badass even though the film doesnt really succeed one hundred percent as a good action flick it still has many enjoyable aspects firstly foremost and obviously denzel theres really nothing that i can say that has yet to be said on him he is just awesome charismatic and badass he has the ability of gluing you to the screen and without him the movie wouldnt exist the other highlight in the cast is definitely marton csokas again nor robert mccall nor teddy have any actual depth as hero or villain but the actors playing them really do a great job and contribute hugely to the fun factor of the movie there is lots of unexpected violence that firstly caught me by surprise but as the film went on it made it all the more exaggerated and enjoyable finally the action scenes are all very well staged even though they dont do anything new they have a great vibe most of all the final climactic scene was actually pretty suspenseful and carried on for just the right time on whole the equalizer was all of the above but it really fell flat in doing anything to make it a superior action movie it is filled with clichés a couple of useless characters and should have been cut by at least ten minutes moreover the visual style of the movie offers some good well staged action scenes but for the rest doesnt feel shot that well there were sometimes where i blinked at the screen because of poor lighting the closure of the movie is totally silly and cheesy finally denzels character is never ever in danger and as much as it was fun looking at him being a badass it didnt add up to a cool hero the stakes were never there the film is just another action movie with very few brains seeing it in the theater is worth the experience but i dont think i will ever watch this again,0.9957,1
You have seen this film before 1000 times,QStrum,16 September 2014,5,a highly trained retired field operative resorts to violence as the only way to free a russian prostitute from brutal russian men who are part of an international crime organization the many years of retirement didnt show any sign of rust on robert mccall washington as he ran through his adversaries dismantling one after another without batting an eye he made it look too easy these bad russian men had nothing for him which is probably the biggest problem with this film there is nothing interesting about a good vs evil film with weak bad guys the filmmakers did work hard at trying to make teddy played by marton csokas look ruthless and deadly but i was never convinced and i doubt whether the many who saw this film with me at the toronto international film festival were convinced as well i found the film rather boring for the most part with a setup unusually longer than anything hollywood released in decades the dialogue was heavy handed the supporting roles didnt provide nothing more than their vulnerability to the scum of society which beckoned on a hero like mccall to teach them a lesson or two and as i stated in my summary you have already seen this film a thousand times already the bad guys shooting big scary guns and rarely grazing the hero the hero walking away in slow motion from an explosion he caused bad guys tracking hero down in this sort of catandmouse thing damsels in distress high octane martial arts wait the filmmakers did try to make the film unique by excluding a car chase and having mccall kill each and every bad guy in the most unique way every time a bullet to the cranium wasnt good enough no he had to use methods like overflowing bathroom sinks to electrocute someone he seemed like he was trying to oneup himself every time the hero doesnt make any mistakes in the process even taking the time to catch a fly ball to win the company baseball game the way he swooped in in slow motion and snatched that ball from the joker character who thought he had it was rollyoureyes worthy and completely laughable however when the film got going it started to be exactly what i expected an entertaining highly stylized popcorn film at the same time being fuquas weakest directorial effort since his first film i cannot recommend it,0.4812,1
"Nothing special, but it certainly delivers",Rickting,3 October 2014,7,denzel washington launches a one man war on the russian mafia sign me up this adaptation of the tv show stars washington as a retired black ops operative who puts the skills from his old life into action when he witnesses a prostitute he has had conversations with getting beaten and throughout the film works his way through the russian mafia this delivers exactly was it says on the tin and is a good well made action movie although youll forget in a week starting with the negatives if you want to see this because youre a fan of chloe grace moretz dont bother since shes in the film for maybe minutes shes completely wasted and as shes the emotional core of a very brutal and action packed film this was a mysterious decision there is a sense of mean spiritedness throughout and the violence which at times feels like a saw movie often feels forced and unnecessary the film is too long and dips from time to time in the middle and for some reason theres an unnecessary sideplot with denzel trying to help a friend lose weight on a regime um this isnt training day this is a fairly formulaic movie and one which goes the motions and lacks a sense of humanity but it is better than you might expect antoine fuqua proves himself once again a skilled director who knows how to build tension and denzel washington is excellent as the main character chloe grace moretz while totally wasted shines in her fleeting moments of screen time the film refuses to go into generic shootouts and fist fights and instead moves from one old school suspenseful set piece to another there are some interesting themes of justice so the film does actually have a quiet power and denzel washingtons character although not given all that much back story gives the film some emotion the finale is a cut above the rest of the movie and genuinely excellent meaning i was on the edge of my seat the whole time this is quite an interesting and slightly different movie which has some appreciated although really not a lot of depth the premise and marketing say its denzel washington taking out the whole russian gangster community in boston thats what we were promised thats what we get,0.971,1
A top rate movie,hcreary,2 October 2014,10,in my humble opinion this movie scores very high it was well acted will an outstanding story line there is violence but that is the reality of the world we currently live in denzel gave a truly outstanding performance as he ages his character unfolds as the story does and pulls the viewer along he plays the part of excia special operator with realism to the point where he is a poster boy to link up with the members of seal team to fight isis such a force would defeat isis quickly not all russians are bad guys and tough but this movie sure convinces you that they are up to no good as you would expect good overcomes evil kudos denzel,0.882,1
Feel good entertainment,Gordon-11,17 February 2017,None,this film tells the story of a mysterious man who works in a home ware store he is kind calm and helpful he also happens to be possessing unparalleled skills in handling extreme violence combating mobs and king them with minimal tools there is a lot of action and violence in the film but it is made to look denzel washington cool he can overpower mobsters easily rectifying wrongs tackling corruption and basically be the pillar of righteousness without looking for any gains or rewards this selflessness makes me like this film a lot even though it may be a little over the top with his specialised skills it offers feel good entertainment,0.9765,1
Typical action movie but with good acting,mahmoudseireg,28 September 2014,7,robin hood ex black ops denzel washington goes on a killing spree of russian gang members the plot is as simple as that really i have always been a fan of thrillers and this movie is a recommended watch if youre a fan of them denzels acting is fine the direction of the action scenes is top notch i liked the enriching camera zooms with slow motion play on the little details in several scenes there were parts where i thought that the story is too straight forward with little left for the imagination i just wish it had more plot twists because the end was pretty predictable couldve given a higher rating had the story been a bit more sophisticated and thrilling,0.9681,1
Totally Denzel!!!,go2dean,25 December 2014,9,i was never a big fan of the original tv series with edward woodward rip but denzel washington in lead here brings a totally new and added dimension with enhanced skills and a huge element of mystery the new robert mccall is just what this piece needed to give it a formidable reboot this movie will either lead to more sequels andor updated tv series if youre looking for great action with a rich flavoring of character interest this movie is for you however there is an element of this character that somewhat reminds me of denzels john creasy in man on fire lots of body bags needed here this was one of the very few films that i can say that i enjoyed every minute of what i also really liked was the fact that mccall was involved in helping several people in this film in addition to chloe moretzs character denzel was in stellar form and i hope he can continue with this franchise should it remain on the big screen,0.9859,1
Neat film. Neato,imxhill,10 October 2023,7,i remember the film being advertised as in the same vein as john wick or taken i even went into the film expecting something similar but the actual movie was nothing like that but it was still satisfying nonetheless i found some interesting parallels between the film itself and its main character the violence while being creative and scrupulous isnt really excessive or overthetop it is quiet and patient on first glance it feels cold stoic and emotionless and it really is for the most part but if you go deeper youll find enough heart and emotion and overall it is just so damn cool maybe couldve packed some more energy not an alltime classic or something but deeply watchable and satisfying cant wait to see the two sequels,0.8319,1
Comic Book Action Well Done,alanjayd-71-74053,2 October 2014,8,denzel washington nails the character at least the character that was written in the screenplay which is not the equalizer from the tv series he is more of a superhero in the movie franchise and you have no doubts that he will outlive all who oppose him the suspense comes in to play more with his friends and acquaintances and the viewer is led to worry about their survival while expecting denzels character to kick a_s without fail the cinematography is dark and the editing is tight with little doubt as to what is going to happen just uncertainty as to how it will happen the equalizer can use anything at hand as a deadly weapon this is entertaining and if there is a sequel it will make money the depiction of the protagonist as a reluctant hero is ludicrous considering his lame retirement job and the pleasure almost joy that he gets out of killing not for intellectuals but good entertainment for action fans,0.8323,1
Let me give you an accurate review (Somewhat of a Spoiler),mlssufan02,27 September 2014,7,denzel is by far my favorite actor so my rating is a tad biased in that regard even so i thought this movie was awesome but a slightly above average compared to such denzel movies as remember the titans malcolm x antwone fisher training day the majority of denzel movies are action thrillers and this was no exception there are generally main complaints with this movie too violent and the supporting actress did not have enough airtime a milder complaint is lack of story i might agree with the supporting actress having lack of airtime as she was pivotal and crucial to the story and pretty much went away after minutes the problem was that this was an old man rescuing a young woman and im sorry but we cant have year old denzel falling in love with a year old it just doesnt work so the only route is protecting her as a father would when that role is played it becomes more like taken where we dont really see the supporting actress though she is pivotal to the story so how about violence well it is violent but there were certainly moments where it could have gone to the extreme it isnt anything new to denzel but you have to understand that the whole theme of bob mccall is someone trained as a killer so he will do things to survive and make him seem ridiculously violent so as to send the message that he is not to be messed with it is violent but necessary for the portrayal of his character the story complaint i sort of agree with i started out fantastic but towards the middle it just felt like it jumped to a completely new story if they had given us a little more explanation of the bad guys maybe their story or something even a small snippet it might have been ok but all the stories seemed like they were supposed to be connected but they did not come across that way in the end product the dialog between bob mccall and alena as well as mccall and the french gang leader are clearly the high spots of the movie denzel still gives a great performance throughout and is as captivating as any other denzel movie it is not the best denzel movie ever and probably not the best denzel action movie ever but it is intense suspenseful and i was glued to my seat for the entire movie,-0.515,0
Righteous Vengeance!,invernessmovieclub,1 October 2014,8,the equalizer is a loose remake of a tv show from the s that starred the late edward woodward it ran for episodes and the lead played robert mccall an exspecial forces agent turned private detective who assisted those in peril following the success of films such as taken the expendables amongst others hollywood has discovered a market for the ageing action hero and therefore it was only a matter of time before a big screen adaption of the equalizer was greenlit the result is a satisfying and often brutal revenge action thriller denzel washington likewise plays kind hearted widower robert mccall known as either bob or mr mccall to his colleagues who by day works in a home depot type outlet and by night lives a quiet life reading books whilst sipping tea at a local diner into the early hours of the morning he befriends a young prostitute teri chloe gracemoretz who also regularly frequents the diner and witnesses her russian pimp strike her after she arrives late to a client soon after she is hospitalised and mccalls conscience tells him that he must take the matter into his own hands after swiftly taking out the pimp and his four colleagues in brutal but gloriously choreographed seconds mccall is advised that he has taken down the east hub of the russian mafia when word reaches mob boss pushkin of mccalls vigilantism he sends highly trained teddy played excellently by kiwi actor marton csokas to find and kill mccall and with half of the boston police department on the payroll its just a matter of time before mccall is found but of course mccall possesses a particular set of skills and the past that he has tried so hard to leave behind has trained him for such an occasion although the plot is nothing new the tension builds well and the action is handled superbly by antoine fuqua training day olympus has fallen there is a number of loud and full on action set pieces but also several quieter scenes which are as equally as gripping denzel washington is as cool as ice and as good as ever and is easily one of the most consistent and reliable actors working in hollywood can you believe he is almost age is definitely not a barrier here the equalizer is one of more surprising films of the gritty tone and occasional splattering of blood set this apart from most of the toned down action films from the last few years whilst its not perfect it has everything a modern action film fan could ask for and if you like your movies with a bit of righteous vengeance then look no further,0.9758,1
More equal than other action movies,Snorreplop,16 December 2014,7,bobby a widower lives alone he has a simple life working for a home improvement store he does not sleep so well and frequently visits a local diner at night to read books and drink tea during this visits he befriends a young russian prostitute alina after some time and an involuntary hospital visit of alina caused by her employer bobby decides to intervene and pay this man a visit watching the equalizer is like a minute déjà vu no pun intended there is not much originality in the story or execution of it this does not mean that it is not entertaining though denzel washington is capable and charismatic enough to capture and hold the attention for the most part of the movie the action sequences are well choreographed and executed but as i said these roads have been traveled before and the equalizer does not bring anything new to equation,0.5087,1
Dumb,razvan-rogoz,3 January 2015,5,im sorry to say but this movie is borderline pathetic it tries to be a combination between taken and action movies and fails at both why for a single reason i didnt sympathized with the main character the hero in movies like taken i could understand his motivations and drive because honestly we would all do the same but in this movie the motivation itself is a cliché i liked the villain more than the hero at least the villain was sophisticated plus this isnt call of duty this guy can run jump fight get shot three times and still be alright fix his wounds with honey defeat a team of special forces kill a dozen people in the city and nobody saw anything or took his fingerprints and i could go on like this until tomorrow the plot defies logic in the final act it would have been simpler to simply bomb the entire complex where the hostages were and they would be done with it the hero is made to look very smart and resourceful compared to everyone else and generally the movie is a bore look hollywood this is our iqs increased a bit since enough with the one man army plot enough with the good guy kills bad guys type of story it is not realistic even the matrix was more realistic than this movie a similar movie was the november man but at least that was a bit more realistic by the end of this movie i despised the hero felt like ive lost two hours of my time and wished i saw something else instead if you want to see something good see training day instead that is his best movie or watch taken and or any other movie that isnt designed following the commando rambo formula,0.9454,1
Way too much violence,rdb59,9 February 2021,6,could have been a great revenge movie but the violence shown is ridiculous and fascistlike totally unnecessary,-0.8608,0
Denzel is the man,bravesfanc,4 October 2014,8,any movie with denzel washington as the main actor im all in my expectations are usually quite high as well because of him once again he doesnt disappoint maybe im biased because ive read about how this is too slow for some people and while that might be true as long as denzel is on the screen im hooked its not full of action like i mentioned before but when there is action its very entertaining its a smart character that has a routine every day and throughout the movie you learn more about his back story and why he is the way that he is its a simple plot really as a young girl he becomes accustomed to gets beaten up pretty bad he decides to make the people pay only problem is its the russian mafia the final action scene in a very large hardware store is fantastic and clever its about minutes long and the kills are brilliant and original there is one last shot that is a bit cliché but im ok with that i had high expectation and i liked it enough to give it a solid,0.9751,1
The Love of Battle Was Not Neglected,maxskyfan-9,27 September 2014,9,this picture looks like it is a wellmade over the top revenge film but it is more in the line of a setting things right for the other characters type of story it looks like this film was based on the tv show of the same name that was released in the according to imdb the tv creator got a movie credit the action and violence in this picture is highly realistic and often brutal robert mccall is not the type of guy to go in locked and loaded and blaze away he is more like to pick up weapons off his targets and make do with what they have lying around like corkscrews or even a shot glass he is pretty much deadly with anything i was reminded of man on fire when i was watching this another denzel film with a pretty and young white girl in trouble with the same determination from the protagonist still i recommend the equalizer the story continually builds upon itself slowly revealing the larger scope of our heros world and the director was very mindful of his spaces and was careful where objects were placed and shown i was pleasantly surprised to keep finding things slide into place in front of the camera but the love of battle was not neglected the fight scenes used elaborate setups in editing where extreme close ups of the protagonists eye would show a reflection of the room mixed in with half a dozen of cutaway shots this was graphically brilliant in its imagination and ever so offputting in its gory nature,0.9788,1
Denzel as a superhero??,crod1995,1 October 2014,7,what else can i say you like denzel washington you like solid action movies you like denzel washington kicking ass than this movie is for you the actingits freaking denzel washington chloe grace moretz with the short amount of screen time she has is good in the movie but shes more of a plot point that gets robert mccall back into this dark world other than that she doesnt have much to do the main villain played by marton csokas was entertaining to watch on screen and the interactions between him and denzel were the best part of the film the action in the movie is creative almost home alone like and some of it is gruesome and will make you flinch but is the action entertaining yea for a good portion of the film it is till you realize that robert mccall is a superhero i mean the man is barely touchable it gets very predictable almost boring every character mr mccall comes up against stands no chance at all except one guy at the end of the movie when you think robert mccall found his match he kills him within a few seconds even when you think theres going to be a final awesome showdown between him and denzels character it doesnt happen robert mccall takes him out with ease antoine fuqua makes a good looking film although sometimes artsy its still nice to watch is this film as good as his other film with denzel washington training day i mean no is it entertaining yes if you like denzel washington this movie is for you if you want to see denzel washington kicking ass and fairly untouchable like a superhero this movie is for you solid action movie,0.9931,1
A feel good action movie,JontheLobsterLover,11 November 2015,8,i really really really thoroughly enjoyed this movie this movie has many things going for it in my opinion the main character is not a typical action hero he has heart hes selfless he is probably what a lot of people wish they could be a hero to others the fact that he takes the time to know everyone help everyone it just makes you feel good and root for him that much more even though chloe grace moretz is only in the movie for a brief period she effectively makes you feel for her character she is an amazing actress and this movie just further proves that fact the soundtrack is amazing and highly adds to the movies mood finally the kills imo are highly creative sure there are a few stab stab stab shoot shoot shoot scenes in the movie but the whole post ending scene in the warehouse i was on the edge of my seat with a grin plastered on my face just waiting for what he was going to do next think hank hill pushed too far one thing i actually disliked about the movie are the shots where the scene would slow down then speed up then slow back down and speed back up again i understand thats the directors style but for me it pulled me out just a tad this movie in an odd way made me feel good about myself its hard to describe but this movie just had that effect on me that makes me think man i wish i could be like robert but in the best way possible,0.95,1
"Graphic Kills, Story Lacks Thrills or Surprises",rgkarim,27 September 2014,7,when you have a denzel washington movie you can be sure that fans are going to flock into the theaters to see the legend himself today i went back into the trenches of the local theater to watch mr washingtons latest adventure entitled the equalizer this film based on a television series from the past has promised some dark justice being served in the streets of new york city with the hint of action that many movie goers have come to expect yet is this just another knockoff taken or is there actually something that helps this movie stick out for those who havent seen the trailers the equalizers plot is about robert mccall a retired special forces agent who chooses a simpler life of working and reading after some major life event of course the dark world that he dove into seldom leaves its denizens alone and mccall finds himself back into the bowels of darkness to correct the problems at hand and just like the trailers promise this movie is indeed dark in nature after a rather drawn out introduction into the world the first mission as seen in the trailer rips off the training wheels and throws you into throngs of violence using the power of quick observation a knock off of sherlock holmes washington brings his skills of improvised weapons use on to the screen while this is clever and quite awesome the downside is the amount of gore that follows his moves and the areas to which those devices are inserted should you go see this film there is hardly any censorship in this film but instead an eyeful of sharp objects being slowly jammed into the unfortunate victims what makes it even worse is the sounds the victims make especially during the prolonged moments where the victim seems to be savoring the kill some of course will like this but for this reviewer there is a limit to how much hostility one can take in a movie unfortunately this scene is not isolated as the carnage and suffering only get more intense with each body added to the count intense suffering aside the next component that you might be wondering about is the action that is promised in the film so what about it well it depends on what you define as action if you are thinking of action like taken where our hero moves through the setting with superhuman reflexes firing bullets with one hit kill accuracy that many gamers would kill for then you will be disappointed instead this action is a bit more conserved focusing more on using his mind then tearing up the bad guys with force sure mccall has some moves that you want to see especially close up martial arts moves to disable the weapon from their hands yet the fight scenes often involve slamming someones face viciously into an object and are over in a matter of seconds from the beginning such brief spurts of action were fine but for an action movie i had expected a little more excitement and a little less torture at the end the battle was a little more to my expectations though still filled with gruesome kills some of which i have to admit were pretty sweet to see sort of like home alone meets the punisher no matter what the scene is though denzel washington brings the edge that you expected to see so much that a few in the audience yelled he is such a bad well i wont finish that quote what else is there to say about this movie you can pretty much guess that it is all about denzel with just about every scene having the legend in it luckily his acting is still top notch and brings a lot to the movie in just his character as for the story well its alright in some places but for the most part its rather plain the main plot itself has very little sustenance with what seemed to be a slight attempt to interlock the cases with a big mafia group it failed for me though and the mafia group became nothing more than more bodies for denzel to pile up denzels character has little story development the fragments we get hastily explained and sometimes illtimed that it loses any value perhaps the only thing that really develops his character is his fight to fall back into the soulless monster he was prior to the movie as he doles out justice yes one will feel a mixture of emotions at the bad guys getting their just desserts but aside from that there isnt much emotional stimulation behind this film as for the dialog and humor they are not strong enough to make up for the story references to classic literature being integrated into the morals was a plus for me a nice twist to the typical overdramatic scenes we often get yet these heart filled moments are offset by yet another curse laden dialogue that seems to become the common trend guess they will never learn huh overall the equalizer is an okay film but failed for me on on a lot of levels fans who will enjoy this the most are those who think denzel can do no wrong and those who just want dark twisted kills the legendary actor still impresses me with his commitment but for this reviewer mr washington cannot carry this movie for an entire two hours my scores for this film are actioncrimethriller movie overall,-0.9926,0

A nice vigilante story – with a ton of brutal violence though,matti_sillen,1 October 2014,6,sentimental vigilante finds his calling in wiping out the mafia one man who is able to level an entire gang it seems to good to be true but denzel washington makes it happen this movie gives us the hope that justice will prevail albeit making some messy hands on the way the movie has a good gloomy vibe good dialogue and nice acting but has so much killing in it that one wanders who holds the title of good guy in the end robert mccall denzel washington seems to be a regular guy just suffering from some insomnia he leads his life in boston working a daytime job at home mart and reading at a diner at night everything changes when teri chloë grace moretz an escort who also visits his diner and a friend is beaten up by her pimp this is the trigger that wakes up the vigilante in mccall at first mccall tries to buy off teris freedom from the russian gangsters that run the escort service but when this appears to be impossible he kills all five gangsters in he room where the meeting takes place here he uses some great combat skills resulting from his past as a ciaagent what follows is a manhunt on mccall in which the russian mob does everything in their power to find him the scene where mobster teddy martin csokas know for playing celeborn in the lord of the rings trilogy visits mccall at his house is a highlight in the movie it has subtlety suspense and great acting by both lead actors if only this movie had more of that on the whole one can say that the character of teddy is a bit overdone an action movie needs a distinct antagonist but making him a psychopath is not enough mccall states his motivation for his fight against injustice during his stay at the house of former cia colleague susan plummer played by melissa leo he explains that someday something terrible was done to someone who didnt deserve it and he wanted to do something about it here we see a glimpse of mccalls history at the cia though this isnt scrutinized any further it all comes down to mccalls coworkers being held hostage which ends up in a big killing finale this scene nicely staged in home mart shows us how the russian mafia is getting whats coming to them mccall kills them to the last man sometimes brutally which put question marks to him being solely a vigilante and not a sadistic killer but at least teri is free now what is great about this movie is denzel washingtons acting as a regular joe and as a mob slayer he is a sentimental man with a good heart but he goes to extremes to fight injustice the fact that the character of robert mccall remains sketchy he hates injustice period is a pity furthermore the director seems to want to give us mindblowing images of explosions and brutal fighting scenes but the fun in this movie is actually in the subtle scenes and the play between actors especially washington gracemoretz and csokas all put together it is a better than average action movie that is worth your time and money only with a sleight bit of overkill the storyline is nice and the actors do their best to make it a good movie though it isnt a brilliant one,0.972,1
Nothing new to see here...,edjofsanity,30 September 2014,5,denzel stars as a man with a hidden past that includes many specialized and dangerous skills the prostitute he befriends is beaten up by the russian mob all he really wanted to do was to encourage her to read classic literature instead hes ready to take down the mob singlehanded it really seemed like the movie was supposed to star liam neesom might of been better too same story as hundreds of other movies just ramp up the violence same denzel how many times do we have to see him squint his eyes and look with serious hatred then suck on his bottom lip it was great in glory but come on man learn some new facial and vocal expressions already he is the same in every movie which only made this worse i suppose its a decent action movie for a matinée or a rental just dont make it your first choice,-0.6807,0
Antoine Fuqua and Richard Wenk revive The Equalizer in a solid genre exercise anchored around Denzel Washington's commanding lead even if the film is longer than needed,IonicBreezeMachine,2 January 2024,7,set in boston massachusetts robert mccall denzel washington is an unassuming man working at home improvement store home mart who while personable and charming is also enigmatic as he keeps his past and private life closed off at a diner he frequents robert has the good fortune to meet a teenage girl named teri chloe grace moretz who cultivates a friendship with robert revealing her true name to be alina who has aspirations of singing after learning that alina has endured a savage beating by her pimp slavi david meunier robert revisits the skills from the life he thought hed left behind with his act of retribution against alinas criminal escort service soon escalating into a fullon war with corrupt cops and russian oligarchs the equalizer is a action thriller based upon the television series of the same name that ran from to and featured edward woodward in the role of robert mccall original series cocreator michael sloan along with producer tony eldridge sought to adapt the series to film around the mid with the two eventually partnering with producer mace neufield and eventually setting up the project at the weinstein company where it lingered in development hell after the weinsteins let their option lapse the project was revived at sony pictures and escape artists as a vehicle for denzel washington with antoine fuqua soon joining as director having previously directed washington in his oscar winning performance in training day while critical reception was mixed though praising washingtons performance and fuquas direction the movie proved a considerable hit for a midbudget adult skewing action thriller earning million against an estimated million budget which gave way to sequels which in a break for washingtons traditional avoidance of sequels or franchises saw him return for each one the equalizer is pretty standard genre fare that doesnt break far from convention but as a genre exercise it delivers on what you want and builds around a solidly engaging character and performance in washingtons mccall from the opening the movie does a solid job of setting up robert mccall with washington playing an enigmatic character of shadowy origin which is pretty standard for this type of film but while washington does play into that side of the character hes also allowed to be charming and possess some humor which keeps the film from feeling rote washingtons performance as mccall shows himself to be someone driven to action and right wrongs and from unscrupulous flesh peddlers and corrupt cops to russian mobsters the movie gives no shortage of irredeemable villains for mccall to lay to waste fuqua and writer richard wenk concoct a number of solid set pieces in the film with one of my favorite aspects being that mccall uses almost exclusively improvised weapons or misdirection on his opponents rather than firearms which keeps the set pieces engaging with that said did the equalizer need to be minutes long probably not especially since it does feel like the kind of story that would be more suited to a streamlined minute runtime thats not to say the equalizer drags its heels or waste time on unnecessary material but there were instances where i could see the plot straying a bit far from the main thread even if it was well acted and had my investment the movie also felt like it didnt use some parts of its cast as much as it couldve with moretz very good in the opening act but disappears until the very end and david harbour feels wasted in his role as a rather nondescript corrupt cop the equalizer is well acted and thrilling with a solid lead actor and some memorable setpieces even if some actors feel a bit underserved and theres maybe a few plot tangents that couldve been reined in for a more streamlined focus however with a pairing of fuqua and washington youre promised something gritty and thrilling and it delivers,0.9868,1
Outlook,semelkajr,25 December 2015,9,a lot like the bourne idenditys it will have you on the edge of your seat denzel as always is captivating as an actor and it is a entertaining film for adults not too often i watch a movie that is believable enough to keep me intrigued and entertaining enough to keep my eyes on the tv i gave it a but its as close to as a as you get great movie their is fight scene in a club that is outrageous denzel really nails the role i would love to see the director andor prodducers come out with another movie like this good movie adults can enjoy,0.9713,1

Denzel is Awesome... The third act not so much,StarkTech,26 September 2014,None,needless to say denzel really elevates this material i truly loved the slow set up and development of the story and his character it was refreshing to see an action film build a base and let the story breath to start i loved denzels slow burn as hes drawn back in his violent ways his deeper philosophy and new life spent imparting life lessons was very well handled its too bad they kind of wasted such an intriguing set up with some very overthetop moments when everything hits the fan spoiler denzel kicking ass at the home mart was a crazier direction then i thought this movie was heading in it reminded me of an r rated version of the tv show chuck attack on the buy more crossed with a steven seagal flick i was expecting more intrigue and smarts to be honest using nail guns and hardware from the store instead of guns seemed too much an attempt to be cool but came across as super gimmicky to me end spoiler as many have mentioned the movie descends in to clichés and may have tried to be too slick for its own good at least they delivered one of the alltime classic cool guys dont look at explosions moments for an update to that montage someday,0.9411,1
You will be equalized!,oceanic_osprey,1 October 2014,7,greetings all i happened upon this film having seen very little advertising save for the odd television teaser from which i discerned a takenesque format and to my pleasure this delivers very much like the first taken did i could draw more comparisons with the wonderfully brutal fight scenes but we all know this formula by now my main praise must go to denzel washington who charismatically plays the introverted unsuspecting lead he brings a weight and dignity to the role that may have been lost had some one else filled this position the action is very convincing with deafeningly loud gunshots and uncompromising handtohand choreography that really leaves you in awe although there is a purpose for his actions i did find it hard to justify some of his killings especially since he appears remorseful over past wrongdoings as supporting casts go this was not star studded and nor did it need to be with nameless henchmen receiving their fair share of fisticuffs left right and center i must give a hand to martin csokas who adopts the lead psychopathic villain with such grace and a reasonable russian accent for me the downside of this film was chloe gracemoretz perhaps it was because of the lighter films in which id seen her feature but i found her a hard pill to swallow as a russianspeaking prostitute in fact it left me a little uneasy at the sight of it as a sucker for a soundtrack i was very aware of the particularly entertaining gritty musical pieces that featured within they grew in decibel as the drama did and the main theme left me wanting more it was somewhat reminiscent in places of electros suite in the amazing spiderman highly recommended overall i would very much recommend this film most definitely if you are a fan the first taken which this will undoubtedly be compared to but more so for its ability to be a decent standalone action thriller if not ever so slightly predictable,0.9889,1

The Second John Wick...,KFstudios2009,13 September 2023,7,the equalizer is an american action movie with denzel washington in the main role as robert mccall a normal man with a background of a secret agent with a purpose to fight for freedom and justice i have to admit that this was a very enjoyable film could fix some small details that i think was important and now im going to tell you what was good and what was bad the buildup of the movie was amazing with great suspense and they explained everything and keeped the story in a way that made sense so i liked the story and the actors were pretty good especially denzel washington as robert mccall the main role and i think the main antagonist nicolai itchenko teddy was very good and very evil a villian that was not important in the beginning but become more important later that i liked the things they could change was that they could make more things less predicatble and to explain more of the things that wasnt explained they could also have more fighting scenes and less scenes that was only about violence beside that things i think this movie was absolutely fantastic i recommend this movie for fans of for example john wick and james bond where the genre is pretty similar to each other it was better than john wick and a movie i think you should watch anyway,0.9806,1
"Bad, really bad (spoiler alert)",spikenard222,15 February 2015,2,wowthis was bad just bad mccall has zero character development i mean literally none by the end of the film we know nothing more about him than we do at the start hes trying to read a hundred books and obsessively keeps time of things why and the garbled explanation about his wife was so confusing that i have no idea what was said i thought at least nicolai would give an interesting story about mccall in the same way that mccall did about him but no we get nothing so how am i supposed to care about this robotic assassin and the action violencesigh hollywood just needs to stop the scenarios are so ludicrous anymore as to be embarrassingly laughable i mean we see mccall in a room with four or five russian gangsters and we just know whats gonna happen the scenes are either so predictable that theyre boring beyond belief or so farfetched as to be unbelievable how many times are we gonna see bad guys with guns feeling the need to get within two feet of the hero so that they are vulnerable to hollywood kung fu or how about minions just bringing the protagonist right to the key leader i just cant suspend my disbelief anymore in the real world assassinating a mafia don would be extremely difficult requiring a lot of planning and luck mccall just waltzes in and does it in an hour thats not believable and the villains you know you need your villain to be credible and effective or theres no urgency to the threat unfortunately these russians despite how tough they look are powderpuff buffoons seriously mccall dispatches them so easily that they cant be taken seriously the only one who actually threatens mccall in any way is the bald guy with the tweaked mustache that was the only point in the whole film when it felt like mccall was in any danger other than that the bad guys just fall for one obvious trick after another this truly was a paintbynumbers ludicrous boring waste of time what did it have to do with the original equalizer anyway,-0.9943,0
UNREALITIC,ahmedghanim-37133,15 May 2024,None,totally unrealistic and one side story if a country had such a men why they do invest billions in aircraft carriers and nucks worst denzels movies shame what about some real fight from the other guy he also highly trained and clever with high magnitudes and abilities or should it be complete spotless victory do people in the writing or production side has any idea about what makes a good film i think there should be some tricks and traps from the other side or only denzels side is the working one and the others are crippled if they were crippled then how they dominate all these cities and investments,-0.5627,0
A kinda mediocre film.,ironcraftleague,7 March 2019,7,its a strange set up for an action thriller i love the ideas and cat and mouse chasing but honestly it has really bad trouble with its messages and direction it felt really bland half the time and it really brought down my interest the characters are passable along with some other elements some great fights scenes are shown and other ways of killing people are also seen the way he works up through the gangsters system and taking them down is very awesome to see however this movie is kinda mediocre to the point where its only passable overall yes it has good things but a lot of other things arent execute well,0.8595,1
Home Alone for adults!,ka-brown12,2 January 2015,8,the equalizer is a very violent film but surprisingly humorous at times for example when densely asks to see the guys gun and looks away then just takes it from him in the warehouse when he sets all the traps its like home alone and you expect one of the bad guys to get hit in the face with and iron or a blowtorch but the bad guys didnt fall for that one you see that the main character can heal himself temporarily but very quickly and still appears to be helping people at the end of the film which leaves it widely open for a sequel i think its very creative and well produced and look forward for and possible sequel good film,0.6945,1
Another Denzel Washington Triumph,yvonne-91633,15 March 2017,7,i cant remember ever watching a denzel washington film i didnt enjoy and this one was no exception i can remember english actor edward woodward pioneering the original american made for television series back in the late and bringing the role of robert mccall to our screens denzel does amazing justice to the film version of this debut vigilante role with a strong story line full of action and violence and a depth of character which sets the scene nicely for any followups which may come along the equalizer is born,0.7765,1
Denzel Washington knows what he is doing,reoroy,22 November 2014,8,i saw the equalizer starring the immensely smart denzel washington as the protagonist he plays this shrewd man called robert mcgall who stays away from what he does best until a day arrives when he comes across a situation which forces him to expose his other side and then all hell breaks loose and thereafter the movies entertainment quotient increases by leaps and bounds denzel washington exudes this chic persona in almost every movie starring him he does the same for this movie and the result is for you to see and the bad guys are just as awesome the man who plays their head seems to be the perfect fit for a heartless villain ready to pounce on his adversary at the first given opportunity antoine fuqua is a lovely director he had directed denzel in the superawesome training day and their second collaboration has done wonders again the city of boston has been shown in all its grandeur buy yourself a plate of nachos and sit back and enjoy watching denzel wreak havoc im sure you are gonna love this movie,0.9722,1

Black Rambo,joeventuraa,2 January 2015,8,watching the end scene i thought how a man of color became a black rambo and denzel is just that in this movie no hesitation accepting he had the skills much like the white rambo in taken men like rambo movie no matter how they are the same picture painted with different colors so what this is a movie and nothing more you have to suspend thought because it meets a visceral need to have power and control it is as old as the dayto see justice in this lifetime this movie like many others portray evil and the wicked heart of man and in this sense the movie was factual and accurate this evil really happens there is gospel in here if you look closely justice must be forthcoming or life is absurd no worse life also then is evil if evil wins in the end it is instant gratification and for men these movies are essential because the equalizer gets justice done so we dont have to in our own world thats the gut or reptilian effect on a pure acting note another example of how character actors are the best and the dude you might meet at home depot or lowes shopping probably has more acting chops that most alist personalities take note mr willis next time generosity is called for support your local theater better yet to the who make the of the money just buy the theater and let upcoming talent do their thing,0.7579,1
Denzel Washington & Chloe Moretz : A great combination,jeffreyhillen-364-945381,10 October 2014,7,when you look at the list of films were chloe moretz played in you really see a big diversity in the characters she played and the films she had done a lot of actors want to keep it safe but chloe doesnt that makes her apart from her brilliant acting skills one of the most talented teenage actors we have at the moment so i was happy she played in this film and when you watch this film you see the combination of chloe moretz and denzel washington works really well as an audience you have to believe that these two characters have this special relationship throughout the film denzel washington delivered an outstanding performance as a very lonely man but without fear you can see it in his eyes that hes been through so much in his life and denzel does an amazing performance on that i think the storyline really great there is a very high pace which makes it never boring there is such a great character development mr mccall isnt just a lonely man who wants vengeance no the audience get to know who he is they developed that really well the problem with this film was for me personally was that everything was going so easy for the main character he never lost a fight and that was something i saw as a bad thing you have to make the right balance between not losing to many fights and not win to many that makes it unpredictable the story wasnt unpredictable but somehow you knew that when was in a fight he would win this i rate this film because of the outstanding performances of denzel washington and chloe moretz but also because of the good working and fantastic written storyline dvdblu ray worthy i very much recommend this film,0.9973,1
Absolutely Denzel at his best !,dnolan714,3 October 2014,10,this movie takes you to a familiar area of the once good guy dark past but kicks it up several notches denzel plays the part of an quiet gentleman a little ocd but friendly he has a heart cares for people and really tries to encourage people around him while living a simple life then he gets p od when someone he cares about is harmed the dark side comes out but with a hint of offering a peaceful resolution the bad guys choose poorly and its on now we see denzels capabilities which are similar to jason bourne aaron cross taken etc you soon realize he is a former very well trained operator again one with a heart the entire production directing acting everything is top notch characters are developed very well and we see fine acting at its best gore and violence yes but definitely entertaining to the max it makes one wonder how many real people are out here that seem like just regular folks but have set aside a former life where they operated in dark places the heroes of our world,0.9927,1
Not quite The Equalizer I remember,tcasavecchia,31 July 2018,7,as a fan of the tv series i was disappointed that this bears little resemblance to its source material that isnt to say this is a bad film in the series edward woodward fed up working as an agent gave it up but wasnt willing to let his expertise go wasted he took out an ad to help those in need he occasionally had help for former colleagues he lived in a nice apartment drove a jag the very city of new york was almost a character unto itself the robert mccall denzel plays him more like liam neeson in the taken series i guess my big problem is once again hollywood has taken a property with name recognition i enjoy this film for what it is but i would still love to see a faithful adaptation of the equalizer,0.9699,1
inferior to the TV series,simonpcpearson,29 September 2014,3,denzil washington is a good actor but he has made a poor decision by agreeing to star in this movie the version of the equalizer is basically a straight to dvd bmovie with an established lead actor in terms of plot and tone this could be any jason statham movie it is nothing more than a generic shoot em up the pacing of the movie is poor and it is a considerable time before anything happens there are a number of action scenes in the latter half of the film but they are shot in a typical modern hollywood style which removes the excitement by distancing the audience because of bad camerawork and editing the script is unimaginative and the modern equalizer has nothing that you havent seen before in countless other films the violence is more gruesome than it needs to be if you want to watch he best of robert mccall then watch the tv series if you want to watch a movie in this style watch taken if you feel that you must watch this then wait for the dvd,-0.6537,0

Denzel is the man!,jaz_rainnrainbows,29 September 2014,9,i loved this movie i honestly wasnt expecting to love it as much i did ive loved denzel ever since i watched man on fire the man is a machine i was slightly disappointed that chloe was only in the movie for a very brief stint but denzel more than makes up for it the movie was pretty gruesome at times left me squirming in my seat at times its a little slow to begin with but once it gets going it gets going i would have enjoyed slightly more of denzels back story and what exactly happened to his wife etc one of my favorite scenes is near the end when the water sprinklers are on denzel is just hard as nails,0.9356,1
Monotonous Plot with Intense Violence,captainmike-michael,10 October 2014,7,the movie has an extremely slow pace before starting off with action scenes though slightly monotonous which is likely due to the intention to present the simple and low profile of the main protagonists life it is generally fine the story does not actually fully reveal the real background and the past of the main character it does get silly with the old style plot by having only a hero who uses violent skills against the villains to restore the peace of the needs denzel washington performs extremely well but when the film focuses too much on him the potential of the supporting cast however being overshadowed by the lack of characters development the score itself has nothing special but the offer of violent brutal and intense action sequences through director antoine fuqua and david s lazan at behind the screen undoubtedly will excite the audiences,-0.8312,0
Action's Back and It Has a Name - Denzel Washington!,fpweeren,27 September 2014,9,what a ride after having wasted minutes of my life watching a certain justice puncture wounds because i pressed the wrong button on the website purchase screen i righted my wrong and treated myself to the equalizer which was the perfect antidote to one of the worst movies ever made denzel gives a stellar performance the plot has a few question marks most of which are cleared up satisfactorily in the run of the film but basically this flick has it all action action action i remember feeling just as excited when bruce willis and danny glover appeared in the first die hard the characters are well portrayed the brutality is realistic and not utterly gratuitous the empathy viewers feel is tangible the plot unfolds like a good book and takes us through everything we need to stay glued to the screen and on the edge of our seats the supporting cast is very good but this is definitely a oneman show and the credit goes to denzel washington i hope they make a sequeland thats something i rarely hope or ask for,0.9714,1

Ultraviolent and yet thoughtful,mgruebel,23 February 2015,7,in this film denzel washington as a former agentturnedhome depot associate bob is confronted with the question must he act against injustices instead of just standing by given his past training as assassin given who he is he befriends a hooker who thinks he is rather a robert than a bob and she is right of course they always chat at the same diner where he sits at a meticulously arranged table reading is latest book such as old man and the sea when she a singer at heart is brutally mutilated by her pimp something snaps and robert starts offering the bad guys an option behave or die none of them take him seriously until they are dying this attracts the attention of the highest echelon of russian crimelords they cant figure out who is messing with their us operations the movie starts out very quietly introducing washingtons character as a man of precision reader of a good novel every night and helper in his community then it turns hyperviolent to set the tone of robert as a clockwork killer he assesses each situation estimates time to mission completion sets his stopwatch and proceeds to cut out eyes with broken glass rims drill though necks strangle people with barbed wire and so forth then he washes up and goes back to work once the film has established his extreme capabilities it dials the mayhem way back to focus on a catandmouse game between robert and the russian emissary who comes after him by the time robert blows up the crimelords shipyard and neutralizes their money laundering operation we are willing to believe that he could do it never mind the details plot holes are avoided such as when robert gets permission from his former agency bosses to clean up the russians the climax in roberts store is well played as the emissary dies one can tell that this is an incredible situation for him how could he who dispatches people like lint suddenly be the lint unfortunately the film then commits the sin of hollywood action flicks incapable of quitting while ahead of the game when robert has walked off into the night the film needed a quiet shot of the unoccupied diner table open to page three of a newspaper announcing a russian mafia lord in moscow has been assassinated then panning over to the latest reading material invisible man instead we get an unnecessary scene of electrocution of said mafia lord in moscow and robert happily ever after meeting up with his friends as though he could agency permission or not despite all the fbi and police have learned all to loud rock music that does not fit the tone of a man quietly equalizing the world for the weak and then robert gets his first text message to save someone on his ipad the call for the sequel could have been stars without the botched ending but a good film even so,-0.1637,0
Pleasing and entertaining,neil-476,2 October 2014,8,robert mccall leads a solitary life apparently subject to ocd and certainly subject to insomnia he spends his days working at a hardware store and the early hours reading classics in his local diner where he exchanges friendly but inconsequential banter with a young hooker when she is hospitalised by her brutal pimp mccall decides that he cant sit and do nothing at which point it becomes clear that there is some juicy detail in his backstory which we are not privy to and neither are the russian mafia into whose territory he has strayed this film revisitation of a tv series starring edward woodward is perhaps somewhat overdue as the premise a lonely vigilante fighting on behalf of the underdog is always a favourite and like liam neesons bryan mills in taken robert mccall is that most satisfying of movie characters someone fighting on the side of good who is both willing to and very good at using the nongentlemanly tactics that the baddies use mccall is a character full of contradictions and illogicalities but he is so well drawn and well played by washington that all the illogicalities make sense by the end of the film washington is aided by very good performances from the rest of the case chloe moretz underage hooker adds another worthwhile entry to her cv and it is particularly good to see marton czokas after years of first class but unremarkable support playing getting to play a truly memorable primary character in the part of mob enforcer teddy this film doesnt have much depth but it is a solidly entertaining and wellmade crowdpleaser,0.9911,1
Denzel Washington is back...,Thanos_Alfie,8 February 2016,7,the equalizer is an action crime movie in which we watch a man believing that he changed and left his past behind him all of these change when he meets a young girl who is under the control of russian gangsters and he decides to help her i liked this movie because it reminded me a combination between the american gangster movie and training day which in my opinion is two of the best movies of denzel washington the plot of this movie is very good with a lot of mystery behind the main character which is something that makes him as the time passes more and more interesting the interpretation of denzel washington is for one more time magnificent another interpretation that has to be mentioned is chloë grace moretzs who played as teri the young girl who is under the control of the russians finally i have to say that the equalizer is a very good movie and i strongly recommend it to everyone to watch in addition to this if you are a fan of denzel washingtons then this movie is a must for you,0.9836,1
Predictable rubbish,livingstone100,25 April 2015,4,i like a good underdog triumphs over adversity movie but we have been here before with denzil man on fire who i previously much respected for his earlier works if you have seen any film in the genre you have already seen this which offers nothing original seems like denzil had a spare couple of months and million also producer credit and thought his name could carry this predictable rehash of edward woodwards original much more believable brand as expected dw is a great actor but he should be ashamed of this carbon copy as should those who voted to bring this to an imdb i am losing faith in this scoring i know people liked this but i guess expectations are currently low,0.8876,1
Great deadly movie 7/10,saadanathan,30 June 2020,7,denzel washington is the only reason this movie is not failing in many cases this movie may seem simple and quite boring any other action movie could have been made like that simple story and plot no surprises nor twists ive seen many of those kinds of movies before but the equalizer is beyond all that it is intriguing and deadly denzel washington delivers a fantastic performance and has most of the best lines in the movie the fact that his character suffers from ocd is important cause the audience can identify with his character see for themselves how he deals with his rivals and threats and how he finds a way to get out of every bad situation one memorable sequence in the film is the one near the ending the home malt sequence where denzels character faces his enemies at the store and sets off traps it is filmed so well that i had to appreciate every shot of that sequence the water dropping from the sealing on his face every moment from that sequence was intriguing and awesome the equalizer is another good movie by antoine fuqua and i wish to see more of denzels character in the future,0.9599,1
Great action packed ride!,amr-ijaz,5 October 2014,8,brilliant adrenaline filled movie played perfectly by denzel with a sublime finesse to his killings all the action scenes were crafted perfectly whilst stopping it from becoming an out and out gore fest there were some other cameos from chloe moretz however denzel played his role with a sense of class and dictated authority on the screen a truly magnificent performance from a stalwart of hollywood the only downside was that some of the action scenes were not dealt with thoroughly and some were skipped over although the ending did drag on it still remained a great movie and good viewing for a boys night out i think it couldve done with a better villain perhaps one that didnt get his hands dirty,0.9612,1
You will become a fan of Denzel Washington after watching The Equalizer,ketgup83,1 March 2015,7,denzel washington amazing editing could have been better denzel washington has created a strong reputation of himself as a hard hitting performer with powerful dialogues coupled with stylishaction stunts the equalizer might be similar to what you have seen before on the silver screen but it the strong charisma of denzel which makes the film simply superb robert is an exarmy man leading a simple and quiet life until one evening his life changes when tries to do the right thing by saving an unknown persons lifebased on tv series the equalizer is a simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes and that is the beauty of this film which was little overstretched in the climax but was saved by astounding denzel washington antonie fuqua training day did pretty well in shaping the movie to be a blunt and taut revenge actionpacked thriller the movie takes sometime to build on you but when it does there is no turning back each scene is beautifully depicted with rocking background score and applauding dialogues icing on the cake is the wellchoreographed action scenes which has been executed brilliantly with graphic bloodshed looking like a pc game script is tight and will keep you engaged the flipside is unnecessary inclusion of climax scenes which could be easily be edited art direction and cinematography is superb i loved denzel washingtons punchline as he turns from a common man into a superhuman rescuing the girl from the hands of evil do not the miss seconds action scenes between him and the thugs chloã grace moretz does well in the supporting role you will become a fan of denzel washington after watching the equalizer good,0.998,1

Great film but in bits and pieces.,katkarashay,2 June 2020,7,i have watched john wick and from some sources i got to know the equalizer is similar to john wick so i was pretty excited as i loved john wick after watching equalizer i had to say it was completely different from john wick it wasnt a fastpaced continuous action film like john wick nor it had much action sequences its rather slowpaced with movie continuosly losing and regaining its grip unlike john wick i was more impressed by the character of denzel washington its not a revenge drama or a detective film its a movie about a man fighting for justice and beyond himself whereas john wick fights for himself denzel washington was charismatic and accurately portrayed his character as far as action is concerned it was more brutal but had far less sequences than john wick if denzel had given an unimpressive performance i wouldnt even have watched it as title suggests some scenes were interesting whereas some were quite boring and unintentional but definately worth a watch,0.5953,1
"Denzel is great, as always!",Blazs91,28 October 2014,9,now is the time for us to get a chance of judging a notable actors performance in a brand new production which will became at lea t as classic as the actor in the leading role after a few years and its name will definitely not sink into oblivion although i havent got any little thoughts about the plot and i havent seen the trailer either id been feeling myself really excited about movie because denzel washington as one of my favorite actors who hasnt made any disappointing movie so far in his carrier and this was the same in the case of the equalizer the acting performance is simply phenomenal denzel is visualizing the usual figure who probably has been an outstanding but now already retired spec ops agent what we cannot be bored of the oscarwinning actor brings life a character of the same style on the canvas almost every time but somehow hes still able to show the audience something new if its needed than ha could be funny and humorous he could be sympathetic and patient but he could also be very tough and serious if the situation required that this is the character which is well known by the wide audience but sometime he could always produce some new attributes and different nature the other actors also performed a flawless job this is chloe grace morezs first performance when she appeared on the big screen like character seemed to be really natural to me so that i couldnt have noticed the slightest spark of acting but i mean this in the good sense the characters really come to life on the screen the storyline is simply brilliant the very beginning felt a bit sluggish during the first minutes i would have been thinking that we would get a fairly towed movie but later the plot will have the ability of catching the audiences attention so hard that you wont feeling of when will it end or this movie is so tardy for a minute of the minutes runtime around the minute of the whole movie it pushes a so brutally epic scene into your face what your brain can hardly accept and process its a so well choreographed and perfectly executed scene that usually could be seen only seen at the end of the movie as the finale of the whole production ive also had the feeling of the movies ended because the scene was immediately followed by minutes of peaceful atmosphere but fortunately its darkened really soon and the tension kept going on the villains are popping up right after each other in the film and we constantly have the opportunity of getting know the bad guys taking their place higher and higher on the hierarchy of the underworld marton csokas has the ability of representing the irritatingly arrogant and disgusting right hand of the mafia whos dealing with all the dirty affairs of his boss but almost everybody will like his character despite of his repulsive nature but because of the excellent acting performance i also bow down before the writer because the dialogues are so funky and fastpaced what i think i havent experienced for years before danzels usual humorous style against the good guys could prevail as effectively just as the usual condescending and efficiently argumentative style against the bad guys he could even twirl the minds of the most elusive and dodgiest criminals effectively by the play of words so that they could react with only silence big eyes and openmouth the restrictions on age in the film is completely legitimate because the fighting scenes are made so brutal and expressive that hey hit the screen with true vengeance ive almost felt the pain when i heard the cracking of an arm or by the sight of a knife slicing through a limb of a lucky man the camera work is not the most appropriate in every single moment because there were some handtohand combat scenes where i could have barely seen whats really happening and whos actually hit who but there is not any bigger and other mistakes in the whole movie at all that i could take into account denzel tries to get to the russian mafia totally alone which could sound totally crazy and incredible but somehow the movie could present the happenings in a more or less realistic way in front of our eyes so that we can totally accept this fact i dont want to spoil the plot and overall essence of the film because its far more pleasuring to realize it by ourselves by seeing the whole production overall the movie is great in my opinion it could smoothly deserve the movie of the year title and id dare to risk a couple of oscars although the movies of this kind are unfortunately not often welcomed by the academy shame on them nevertheless i would recommend the film to almost everyone who has the ability of enduring the brutality on a serious level and for the fans of denzel its a mustsee masterpiece rating,0.9929,1
Ten facts about the Equalizer Denzel,westfield-john,20 September 2015,6,he prefers books over movies he dislikes wearing cherry curls he never blushes in front of girls he is fascinated by russian kitchen and night life he loves well furnished rooms he enjoys destroying them completely he doesnt like bloodless victories he cant dance but serves well as one man army he is overwhelmed by autistic thinking he cant count well or why would he let go the classy chick just with a bunch of dollars while having them stock piled in front of him through half of the movie resumee somewhat overdrawn spectacular towards the end but many bad guys hot chicks lots of cool fx out of,0.8365,1
He's coming out of retirement,professorofsandseology,4 November 2014,9,fast paced action sweet closeup slow motion shots and a terrific story make the equalizer starring denzel washington a must see for any action or drama movie lover unlike some action movies that tend to lean on long intense gun fights or action sequences to make up for a lack in story the equalizer has an amazing story to accompany the awesome action sequences viewers will undoubtedly take away from this movie another thing this film does well in is taking its time to explain the plot and each character it doesnt skimp on any part of the story especially the characters the equalizer explains in detail each main character and some of the submain characters and how they fit into the movie by the end of the movie if you pay attention you can pick out each character and tell what their role is in the movie even if the names are a little hard to pronounce the story flows throughout the whole movie and never leaves you bored and looking for the exit of the theater it will make you feel connected to the characters even some of the minor ones the equalizer is great at keeping you on the edge of your seat camera work is a big part of why i gave this movie a the camera will get closeup during certain scenes and gives a perfect sense of symbolism it makes great use of power shots when the camera is facing upwards at a character giving the sense of superior power it also makes amazing use of dramatic shots especially with washingtons character you will see my favorite shot in the entire movie near the end dont worry no spoilers when it zooms closeup on washingtons face and slows down the role to show the water falling on and off of his face and head that shot gave me chills the only bad thing i have to say about this movie is that you never really find out what washingtons character did before this movie took place you find out what kind of connections he has but nothing more but at the same time i did like that sense of mystery around his character it worked perfectly for the movie the equalizer is a must see even if you dont particularly like action movies there is a terrific enough story to keep anyone interested in this movie denzel washington never seems to disappoint definitely earns,0.9936,1

So boring I fell asleep,mingsphinx,22 February 2015,1,seriously it was that bad normally a movie featuring so many guns and spilling so much blood would get my attention but the action sequences were just dumb from beginning to the end the whole thing felt like a mindless grind and you could tell from the sticky performances of the actors that they thought the project was stupid too but with a million budget it must have been a nice payday for everyone involved and so they went through the motion to get the movie done denzel washington shows his age and is unconvincing as a super assassin he is too rotund around the waist for people to believe that he has the quick moves needed to get the kills washington is best suited for a movie like flight where he played a bitter and washed up alcoholic for his own sake he should either get in shape or turn down these action roles the equalizer should never have been made there is no need to insult the audience with this kind of trash unfortunately it is rumored that they are making a sequel save your money and give this one a pass,-0.6757,0

It's good to fantasize about being able to cheat the odds,orlando-somera,14 October 2014,8,the run up is a little slow but does invest the film with a little more soul than it would have had without it and it also gives chloe grace moretz an opportunity to show her stuff the thing about action movies like this is that they have to seem just plausible enough or the whole thing crashes down that requirement is fulfilled here and you are able to enjoy a ride you dont see much anymore the hypertalented agent willing to get back in action denzel is up to the task and so is chloe but for me at least the most surprising delight was that of the bad guy played by marton csokas the guy plays a russian fixer who is called in to restore the criminal status quo and in a few beautifully acted scenes youre convinced hes going to succeed a good time at the movies,0.9924,1

A waste of screen talent....,mytrbilbo,30 September 2014,2,expecting a literate interpretation of the ohso famous iconic edward woodward equalizer this was a total disgrace to that theme and title woodwards equalizer was understated intelligent well acted complex in character and storyline and thus engrossing and entertaining this thin poorly written shotem up show case for denzel is a pointless showcase for his depth or even his screen charisma surely he didnt read this before he signed in the story is so flawed it reeks of somebody didnt attend the read thru of this screen playwithout spoiling just watch for the huge disconnects in timeline and locations once the so called action beginsand that to take forever given the vapidness of this overused dialogue the music simply drowns this film in some supposed dark power vibe that never matches the scene or the transitions particularly the drone even over rides some key denzel dialogue and our new theater is dhl certified so was not the sound system it didnt fit didnt add and certainly was annoying at best denzel has a few charming moments but as a menace never neither the scenes nor dialogue supported that not a salute to the classy involved intelligent entertaining equalizer woodward immortalizedand really painful watching denzel trying to make something out of this boring story first neg post ive written in years but wow pass on this one,0.813,1
allyourbasearebelongtous - fighting for justice in godmode,johannes-marks,14 December 2014,6,in my opinion this movie has two things going for it its start the protagonist is just one of those worldliteratureloving working at a hardwarestore insomniac retired blackopskindaguys hes helping the people around himself better themselves and is generally a pretty cool guy the story starts off slow but you get enough time to get to know the characters and get attached to them although in the trailers it looks like the young prostitute alina played indifferently by chloe moretz and what happens to her are the starting point for denzels characters hunt for justice she gets beaten up once and then pretty much disappears denzel washington hes just badass apart from those i think the equalizer wasted a lot of potential none of the mooks the russian mob sends against him wahshington stands any chance and theres really only one instance in the plot where denzels character richard i think actually has to fight for his life briefly in other comparable movies like for example taken for me a lot of the suspense was created by the fact that although taking names and chewing gum the protagonist was still just a human this feeling disappeared quickly watching the beginning of the second act of the equalizer all things considered i still believe the equalizer to be an enjoyable way to spend two hours but if you havent seen a lot of these huntforrevengekindofmovies id recommend seeing the better ones first taken the man from nowhere the bourne trilogy the list goes on,0.9717,1
Brutally Fun,alexanderpratl,26 July 2023,8,the equalizer positive denzel washington carries the film with his charisma and plays a great character who has an incredibly likeable and heroic nature the story is simple but works well and is an exciting mix of john wickfilm noir and action films although the story is thin it fits well into the nature of the film and still knows how to captivate the entire run length the film has many interesting characters and element such as corruption prostitution or david harbor plays a corrupt cop with a great chzarackter development the kills and fight scenes are really engaging and are very creative and brutal the entire finale from the hardware store to the russian villa is awesome and you sit there with your mouth open and are happy about each of the creative kills negative the plot of the film is too thin and full of clichés and views dialogues and fight scenes despite the good elements many elements look like john wick lite or have often appeared in other films and this unfortunately makes the story quite forgettable the russian mafia antagonist is a walking cliché and teddy as the major antagonist is awful and a single overacting and no motivation or memorable conclusion a classic and fun revenge thriller with really brutal kills and an incredibly symphonic denzel washington the film is a colorful mix of genres and sometimes looks like a darker john wick nevertheless the film doesnt live up to its role models and gets lost in its annoying clichés and its nonexistent story the badly written russians dont help either still you end up sitting there with a smile on your face and it remains an impressive performer,-0.6328,0
Great Paced Action Film,Floated2,18 May 2015,7,the equalizer better yet fill the empty box with denzel washington secure in his position coolly cranking out box office hits then dress it up a bit so it looks like its about a few halfway relevant things or even just one thing or even just half of a thing and if that half of a thing is denzel washington fighting the faces off of bad dudes with lumber and drills and his bare hands then thats a good enough half of a thing washington is robert mccall a boston man with a mysterious past he lives quietly and works at a home depotstyle store called home mart hes an insomniac spending his nights reading classic literature in a hour diner so edward hopperish that it might as well be named nighthawks he reads the old man and the sea he reads don quixote these titles are meant to convey the shape of his soul and the deeper themes a different film might explore aim well movie fill that box as for a rewatch this film is definitely more slower paced than one remembers the action is there and far out within each other and denzel is great in this role the equalizer being compared to john wick is quite accurate both very similar films in tone and story the equalizer is still a solid slower paced action film,0.9295,1

Liam Neeson found his match,vistheindian,20 October 2014,7,quickie review robert mccall denzel washington is a law abiding citizen respected by all his peers he has chosen to leave his dark and mysterious past behind to live a quiet life however when his friends are threatened by criminals and corrupt cops robert cannot sit idly by and takes matters into his own methodical hands the equalizer is not deep in narrative or storytelling but quite frankly it doesnt have to be this is just a fun film where you just get to relax with your snacks and drinks to watch denzel washington kick rearends till the very end if thats all you want and need youll be more than satisfied full review lets be honest here nobody is expecting an instant classic from this movie as long as this movie delivered on the fun action it did its job thankfully it was entirely denzel washington show and he killed it in his role while he killed the russian mob i tend to like the more methodical action heroes people who give attention to the smallest detail for everything they do you see that throughout the movie where washington is thinking ahead and timing his moves perfectly the fights are well shot too with little shaky cam and perfect sound to really make every punch or shot feel painful the villain played by marton csokas was actually pretty good they couldve gone the generic villain route and this movie would still have worked but marton csokas brought in just the right amount of unbalanced temper that he was big enough threat to care about the equalizer is not without faults one in particular that kind of took me out of the movie was that there were way too many subplots within a short time span this also made it feel longer than it should other than the main plot of the russian mob there were two or three other subplots where the washingtons character needs to intervene additional criminals andor corrupt cops these were supposed to show how loyal and honorable robert is yet i feel this couldve been achieved through the main plot itself making the overall movie a bit more concise overall i enjoyed watching the equalizer i got exactly what i was looking for fans of movie such taken dredd or some fighting elements of bourne trilogy will find it to be an entertaining time in the cinemas now let just have a crossover with taken to watch denzel washington and liam neeson duke it out check out more on my movie review blog the stub collector,0.9863,1
Denzel is Phenomenal in This,tkdlifemagazine,4 September 2023,8,i had no idea that this movie and the original john wick movie came out a month apart i know the equalizer is based upon the television series but the style is very similar to john wick a likable man trying to live a quiet life gets sucked back into using his deadly skillset when dealing with russian mobsters the film is also violent and showcases beautifully its stars fighting and weapons skills the film like john wick is also the basis for a series of follow up films which has all been well received by the public even above the critics denzel washington is perfect in this film he is the perfectly deadly yet likable and noble antihero martin csokas from into the badlands is phenomenal in this he is a great villain david harbour is always watchable anton fuqua is a great action director and this is no exception his prior work with washington a big plus here this is very watchable,0.9217,1

Denzel is a bad mf in this,MLDinTN,2 June 2015,7,well liam neeson must have been busy so the producers got denzel washington to take the lead this character is exactly what neeson has been playing in his recent movies like taken i guess now that denzel is over he wants to become an action star like neeson in this film quite mild mannered robert mccall whom works at a home depot type of store befriends a young hooker well the russian mob beats her up and hes mad first he tries to buy her freedom but when that fails we find out exactly what kind of a guy mccall really is pretty good scene as to how he takes care of the gangsters well the head of the mob is losing money so he sends his ace guy to find out whom killed his guys the guy tracks down mccall and hes not prepared for whom hes up against mccall visits some old friends to find out whom these mob guys are and then its on mccall uses his skills to take care of the bad guys in some pretty cool ways never using a gun final verdict fun over the top action flick if you are tired of shoot outs check this movie out,0.9665,1
Possessed the usual flaws most good guy/bad guy films do,ahthewarmthofthesun,28 September 2014,3,i find it completely unbelievable that teddy didnt take every opportunity to dispatch robert as quickly as possible but as usual the bad guys hem and haw and want to study their deadly foe rather then just try and eliminate him on site i found that unrealistic and as i said typical of these types of movies it of course allows our hero to lay waste to all the baddies and stay standing at the end dumb in my opinion yeah roberts character was not the standard opponent that teddies group was used to coming up against as was spelled out in the movie so they wanted to take robert alive to see if they could find out who he was working for but still just thought it made little sense that the baddies would not attempt eliminate such a dangerous threat asap,-0.9439,0
"A decent flick, but predictable",erikmsandreid,22 December 2020,7,if youve seen any great action movies the last years youll see nothing new with the equalizer the movie was well made acted paced directed and entertaining only complain i can really make of the movie is that its too formulaic with other movies like taken sherlock holmes or even john wick the plot is anything but unpredictable if this wasnt the case you would easily look at a or maybe even movie in the equalizer go give it a watch if you havent already,0.7992,1

A Thrilling Action Film with Denzel Washington's Stellar Performance,cinephilescientist,23 May 2023,8,the equalizer starring denzel washington is an impressive action film that delivers a satisfying experience the movie captivates the audience with its engaging and fastpaced narrative from the beginning the action scenes escalate the tension providing viewers with a visually stunning spectacle that keeps them on the edge of their seats denzel washingtons performance is one of the standout elements that make the film truly worth watching portraying a strong and determined advocate of justice he showcases his acting prowess at its peak washington skillfully embodies the character displaying both physical prowess and emotional depth the films visual effects and cinematography also contribute to its success the action sequences are intelligently crafted with wellchosen camera angles and swift editing resulting in a breathtaking experience these scenes take the audience on a thrilling journey maintaining a high level of action throughout and enhancing the overall quality of the film however it can be said that the story is predictable at certain points some plot twists can be anticipated which may slightly reduce the excitement for some viewers nevertheless the satisfying performances and impressive action sequences help to balance out this predictability factor the equalizer can be regarded as a highquality action film that offers an engaging experience thanks to denzel washingtons magnificent acting and the visual spectacle it presents despite some predictability in the plot the film succeeds in captivating the audience with its satisfying performances and a strong pace of action it is definitely a recommended watch for action enthusiasts,0.9971,1
Cliched But Entertaining,annie-17136,6 May 2020,7,just viewed this movie tonight denzel fans should enjoy it similar to his role in man of fire it is essentially a good action movie about a bad good guy going after the bad bad guys russian mobsters and the good bad guys corrupt cops after an encounter with a young prostitute in a cafe i loved the original tv series edward woodward was one of my all time favourite british actors from the immensely enjoyable spy series callan and the movies wicker man and breaker morant i was hesitant to watch this film as i thought it was going to be an over the top american take on a classic british show while it may be over the top the film doesnt resemble the tv show except for his name this film is quite gruesome in its action scenes and the over use of squelchy sound effects when denzel dishes out his justice is annoying there are some good performances from other cast members marton csokas is excellent as the softly spoken cold to the bone marrow russian sent to sort things out the fight out near the end of the film is dark as in not enough light to see whats going on but you knew when someone got slaughtered as the loud squelching sound effects kicked in the scene with some constructive use of razor wire had me laughing denzel manages to quickly rig up a pully type arrangement with razor wire while being pursued by five baddies anyone who has ever tried to work with wire knows it is the most uncooperative stuff ever invented and certainly wouldnt magically uncoil without a big fight denzel is one step ahead of everyone in this film and we get the idea that denzel may have been a bad guy in his earlier life but the ending was too quick which spoilt all the previous tension building retribution and that is all i have to say about that,-0.0,0
"Breathtaking, phenomenal, astounding, remarkable!",breathedirt,28 June 2018,10,theres always something to improve but i had to give this movie it movie was simply remarkable and even though the story was predictable to an extent it seemed to me as if every scene of the movie was carefully planned directed reviewed and redirected to make it look meaningful and extraordinary at the very beginning there are several scenes shot at a small cafeteria where denzel goes to read books and which also a young escort girl frequents when they are having a conversation the escort girl surprises denzel with her knowledge of people the small clues she learned to observe about people when working as an escort im teri bob you dont look like a bob you look like a robert robert reads books like this bob watches tv when she is severely beaten up by her pimp denzel decides to come back from his retirement and bring justice one last time he then kills her pimp and everyone else in the room who underestimated him because of his age and calm personality when nicolai marton csokas comes to the city to clean up the mess and get rid of the killer denzel he gathers all the information available until he narrows down the suspects to denzel and pays him a visit impersonating a police officer investigating a murder when leaving ill be in touch dont you want to leave me your card officer in case i remember anything thats what you policemen usually do right must have given them all out how did you find me last but not least the ending fighting scene was simply phenomenal it was like home alone for adults denzel as kevin and marton with his mercenaries as the burglars who in this rrated version didnt end up in jail by the way i really dont understand the negative reviews here enjoy,-0.9732,0
Too long and full of action tropes,omega145,20 September 2021,6,pros denzel without him this movie is very bad chloe not in the movie enough strong scenes between the good hand to hand combat unique weapon use cons villain caricatures stereotyped russian mob dirty boston cops action movie tropes ex special forces works a normal job and gets sucked back inexplosions with main character walking away does this really need to be over hours long little character development for being such a long movie,-0.5849,0
"Virtue, valor, strength and Denzel to bring it all together",stevojaxon,30 December 2019,8,it is going to be good even before i see it denzel picks roles that work for him the budget is there to support it and the film maker is good at what he does its a formula and it works to produce movies that i enjoy a lot in recent years there have been similar hero antihero movies coming out with big name stars playing them i remember a lot of them being similarly good after i watched the equalizer i thought to myself that i knew it was going to be good,0.9678,1
Great .... except the end.,lucas739,12 January 2015,7,i sat down to watch this film not expecting much but i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised i enjoyed it so much i was compelled to write a review so that says something denzel washington puts in a solid performance as the lead character ably supported by a rather hot chloe grace moretz amongst others plus a host of your usual eastern european tattoo covered mobsters the film builds nicely from a rather slow start a start which contrasts well with the action to come giving you no clue as to what will unfold my only caveat is with the end sceneboss fight thankfully it wasnt a shirtless gladiatorial fight to the death however the scene is set inside a diy superstore where our hero uses a variety of store products to dispatch those pesky russians i can see a parody where as he hangs one baddie with barbed wire using cement bags as a counterweight i can see him pausing to say barbed wire not just for fencing and only a foot he proceeds to use a cordless drill some kind of long handled shears gas bottles etc etc just looked a bit naff and took the edge off what was up until that point a very solid film definitely worth a watch,0.9835,1
Equal to nothing,deastman_uk,14 October 2014,4,this had the magic combination of unpleasant violence without relevance there was absolutely nothing original zero thats unusual it wasnt a star vehicle for anybody denzel could not decide whether he was charles bronson or steven segal he settled for forest gump perhaps hit girl could have done better too the film could have been almost minutes shorter but insisted on nonsense exposition of the revenge type but every aspect of this type of film has been bettered elsewhere id be surprised if the russian community dont complain every russian with a line or grunt was a dumb psycho please just ignore this pile of shite,-0.921,0

Im blown away its amazing action film,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,2 September 2023,9,denzel washingtonsthe equalizer is a highimpact reminder of his diverse career combining action thrillers and dramas the film is based on the tv series man on fire and stars edward woodward as a former covert operative despite lacking gravitas the movie is sturdy in pure entertainment with washington taking his stealth vigilante role seriously he pulls out his charm and deadly force unlike many of his oscarnominated performances in flight or malcolm x at denzel remains dependable as a man who gets the job done and draws a crowd at theaters the equalizer stars robert mccall as a lowprofile clerk at a boston home depot washington a former gladys knight backup singerdancer lives a serene life with his coworkers who respect his quiet demeanor mccall jokes about his past mentioning he used to be a pip a character he plays with respect and trust the film explores themes of past relationships friendships and the impact of past experiences on the character mccall a skilled and skilled pip can predict explosive situations with precision and swiftly eliminate potential threats he uses a watch timer to determine the time it takes to eliminate a threat despite not using these skills for a while he spends his nights reading classics in an allnight diner he is soon called upon to use his fighting skills after meeting a wounded teen call girl who hangs out at the restaurant between clients his skills are evident in his ability to predict and eliminate potential threats the equalizer is a violent action film directed by fuqua featuring a crude ballet of violence and water aiming to wash away evil the films showdown in a megastore workplace is entertaining as it showcases washingtons ability to transform everyday hardware supplies into lethal weaponry the film serves as an origin story for a new franchise with an ending that suggests a new franchise is afoot the film also acknowledges that those who qualify for a senior discount can also be crusaders making it a welcome addition to the action game the films focus on mayhem in a place of commerce is a fan favorite since dawn of the deads climactic zombiesvshumans battle denzel washington returns to the role of former blackops commando robert mccall in the film the equalizer a remake of the tv series the film follows mccall who volunteers to assist a young prostitute named lena chloë grace moretz who has been assaulted by her pimp mccall has a meticulous daily routine including a smoothie in the morning working at a diy superstore and advising colleagues at a diy superstore he also spends time with lena sharing his wisdom and reading classic works of literature the film is a small drama with a vague air of menace and its quite compelling the equalizer is a small drama with a vague air of menace making it a compelling addition to the genre mccall a yearold actor takes out lenas assailants in just seconds at a private bar leading to a chaotic situation the pimps are part of a massive russian crime syndicate led by pushkin who sends his enforcer teddy to deal with the situation dozens of people are killed shot dead and their testicles thrown in their mouths the film has two issues the desensitization to violence and the audiences disbelief as the toughest killers are laced by a man who can remember the moon landings despite these issues denzels performance as teddy is impressive making even the most preposterous action scenes thrilling however his strength lies in his convincing toughness preventing the endofthesecondact moment where everything seems lost as mccall returns to overturn the oligopoly the film forgets the issues of ageing and loss which could be remembered when mccall returns for a sequel,-0.9486,0

Entirely too predictable..,manojative,2 November 2014,6,the only thing that was not predictable was somehow you sensed some twist is coming but it never does a regular superhero movie without being called it that the protagonist our beloved mr washington never sets a foot wrong never ever gets beaten and is always two steps ahead of the bad guys the action sequences are well done and i quite enjoyed them the humane story arcs of helping someone at your mundane jobs playing batman at night and telling that he had a dark and painful past was too forced he takes a break from all the action travels to some important persons house for a few days just to explain that there is a past minutes just for that out of nowhere there is absolutely no reason for anyone to spoil the movie it spoils itself,0.8262,1
"Nice killing scenes, but poor story",DaNunes,18 February 2015,8,a classic denzel washington movie his looks and faces blazing guns and some story and you enjoy the hell out of it its an entertaining movie just to watch relax and see some shooting the story is full of clichés such as military background going under the radar prostitutes to save and all that but in the end you end up liking it however there were some issues that i found annoying the thing with his watch that he uses only in some parts of the movie to time his actions is never explained the old russian mob cliché old story other actors really no one could find that girl and just like that get all the images for all cameras from six blocks yeah,0.5804,1
True Justice,victuki,23 October 2014,7,based on a tv show from the s but with some changes mccall was a british sas exoperative not an american comes this remake directed by antoine fuqua olympus has fallen denzel washington is robert mccall a former cia operative that is morally compelled to go back into action to help a lady in distress though it looks like the ateam it is surprisingly deep in terms of character motivation and those characters are way better performed than the standard blockbuster movies fuqua is reunited with washington after training day the film that got him an oscar award as best leading actor fuqua has made some major blockbusters but all of them very well crafted and full of deeplayered characters that reach you king arthur or shooter both blockbusters that were also critically acclaimed he usually gets to work with solid cast and this time is no different chloë grace moretz dark shadows or marton csokas lord of the rings or the bourne supremacy support washington and they both deliver csokas is great as a crazy russian operative bottom line a great action movie the kind you watch all over again every time is on tv lets not kid ourselves if we had to choose a film to take with us to an isolated island we would not choose a david lynch or a hitchcock film but something like this or the lethal weapon saga nuff said,0.994,1

Such a waste of good material and acting,dr-ross-taylor,17 November 2016,2,this movie was such a disappointment i felt compelled to write my first review denzel washington usually does a good job of selecting movies to star in that are good for what they are some are deeper than others but that is ok because whether the movie is mindless action deeply inspirational comedy of some other genre it is still entertaining if it is done well this is the first movie i have seen of washingtons where i felt the movie was well below average the acting was fine but the storyline was stupid it alternated between trying to be deep and thought provoking only to then have the characters do things that would be incredibly stupid in real life the writers and directors were just being lazy and having characters do things to make a point they wanted to make or to advance the plot with no regard for whether or not it made sense for that character to take that action i loved the equalizer series part of the charm was that edward woodward was a secret agent who was past his prime he was still very competent but he had to rely more on planning and getting help from others i knew that would be difficult to do in a movie format instead of a series but i had hoped that with denzel in the movie it would at least be good instead the movie starts interesting enough then gets stupid spoiling the more thoughtful storyline has a brief intense action scene and then for the rest of the movie i had lost respect for the credibility of the plot and was alternatively bored at the attempts for depth the laziness of contrived plot points and the over the top action this movie was such a waste of talented actors the actors did a good job with the well written plot line and if the movie would have stuck to trying to be a story driven drama it would have been very good the action scenes were good but getting to them seemed contrived it was like they wrote the action scenes then had to figure out how to work them into the movie if the movie wanted to just be an action movie with very little meaningful plot the scenes would have been very good but there needed to be more action i cant recommend this movie to anyone if you are in the mood for action there is not enough if you want a compelling storyline they do not tell it well and insert dumb scenes into the movie to either preach at the audience or to give an excuse for the action scenes it seemed to me like the people making the movie had a good story but then were worried that the general viewing public would be to stupid to get the point if they did not include lots of talking about the evils of no spoilers and then throw in some action scenes for the masses i still plan on watching any movie with denzel washington in it this rubbish was not his fault unless he had creative input but i continue to be disappointed at the large number of movies being produced that seem to cobbled together to reach an audience but lack focus on being entertaining,0.9922,1
Very underrated film,danielhart-87957,2 April 2017,7,despite this been a pretty solid film it is generally criticized in the film community it is an action film but a wellstructured film denzels character does fool with you which such a simplistic approach to life that does not prepare you for the rest of the journey to those who enjoy taken you must enjoy this we discuss why we like this film on our movie podcast,0.7741,1
And Justice For All,OMTR,9 May 2023,9,denzel washington is robert mccall a man who leads a quiet life in boston works in a hardware store helps his colleagues at work and in their private lives whenever they ask for help and spends part of his nights reading in a small and restful allnight diner of his neighborhood there he meets teri an underage prostitute exploited by an eastern european mafia one night teri disrupts her habits and robert investigates her disappearance only to find her beaten to death in intensive care at a nearby hospital this is when we start to learn a bit more about roberts past and who he can be when justice doesnt prevail denzel washington and chloë grace moretz turn in great performances in their respective roles as do the actors who play loathsome villains,0.886,1

The first film of The Equalizer based on the TV show.,jackthepgl,10 August 2023,8,based on the tv series in the the equalizer came to my mind now i have not watched the show in general but since i heard of this movie everyone knows denzel washington is a fantastic actor and hell do anything to keep up the best quite frankly the sequel came out in and i havent seen it yet and ill get around to doing it all right lets just get on with it a u s marine turned dia intelligence officer named robert mccall played by denzel washington who works at the home mart hardware store while spending some late nights reading in a diner and he comes across teri played by chloë grace moretz who works as a teenage prostitute for the russian mafia one night she is hospitalized after being beaten by her pimp named slavi he meets her friend mandy and he visits slavi to buy her freedom you know this is just like john wick to me not just to say that its been released the same year but to think that the action scenes look very similar the fight scenes are very well choreographed and denzel does an impressive job with the fight scenes some people say that this is one of the best action films in depending what i saw id say i liked what i see this is a really good film,0.9912,1
"Action, Reaction and Satisfaction",newmailbrendan,12 December 2014,7,the equalizer the equalizer is about a man whos going back to who he once was the choice that led to his decision was when he saw a girl living a life she want to live differently she is forced by people to do things she dont want to do and in order to stop it is by killing the man which is responsible for all that as in the course of time we learn that their are more organizations and networks clogged in the underworld but a man whos biggest fear is his own rivalry is going to change what nobody thought but himself was possible to change the well earned redemption of people who do no good in life their are some hard challenges on the road for him but on the way to satisfaction he shows us that bad people will in a curtain time in their life be payed off for what theyve done andor caused not only he deliver the message that he wants to deliver he also delivers peace and rest in the life of her as well as in his he continues do to what he does best protecting and serve and to tell all that in about hour run time wow that must be harder to be done than what he has all done in the movie sadly we didnt see much of the girls life she always want it to live and the ending let us sitting with a often common seen end we see in those regular actionthrilling hero movies but the way of writing and telling the movie is extraordinary well done in that particularly genre review by brendan resnick,0.9623,1
Great flair,robertemerald,31 January 2019,10,i avoided this movie for years because it was very obviously just another big star big action movie its better than that it reminds me of bourne movies highly professional and really really enjoyable the filming is super wherever this movie goes streets bars stores one gets a real sense of rich urban texture for no other reason this is a great look at boston the director has a talent for lighting and sympathetic closeups as well as a sort of earthy pathos its a good length its a good pace how the baddie got his accent is pure talent denzil is as cool as man on fire this movie is a guaranteed antidote,0.9835,1
So here is another super hero in human form...,james_tabang,21 January 2015,6,theres no doubt denzel was able to portray the stoic character of the protagonist in fact he did it perfectly so as to appear that he was the real villain one would as usual expect spectacular effects from such wealthy companies as sony and columbia but the story was disappointing here we have an agent who assassinates adversaries perfectly in every situation with minimal to no damage taken at all the girl was even set aside in the midsection of the film and laughably reemerges in the final scene maybe so as to remind viewers her significance in the film was not fully set aside plus some would find the insertion of a meaningful quote at the beginning baffling the movie doesnt even provoke pity or at the very least understanding of the main characters situation with so many slowmotion and timelapses in between scenes one can vividly picture the aim of the movie to impress viewers with force which some people may see as arrogance it is a commercial action movie though so most who are satisfied with intense action and little drama would find this film worthy of taking their time,0.9164,1
Excellent actors and excellent characters,jmbradil,5 September 2023,9,just great acting by denzel the action was awesome but the compassion and empathy was also great characters and actors the movie had a combination of clint eastwood die hard bruce and charles bronson movies its one those movies you can watch again and again denzel is just an amazing actor because he can play the hero and the villain training day was one of his best performances and my favorite denzel hayes washington jr born december is an american actor producer and director in a career spanning over four decades washington has received numerous accolades including a tony award two academy awards three golden globe awards and two silver bears he is also a time naacp image award winner with four consecutive wins in the outstanding actor in a motion picture award category from and again from he was honored with the cecil b demille lifetime achievement award in the afi life achievement award in and in the new york times named him the greatest actor of the century in washington received the presidential medal of freedom,0.9986,1
Equal Eyes Equalise Equal Lies,callumniatory,11 January 2015,7,i regard this film nicely however there are many points to this movie that made me feel like man that wasnt equal at all why call it the equalizer this question of identity invoked me to comment and review this artistic representation of exkillers working at home depots denzel washington did a superb job representing an intellectual ex killer working an ordinary and satisfying job at what seemed to be a franchise hardware store i myself would have preferred glasses denzel in this particular film but i realize that if we were to take him as what he was he would seem a little bit like a serial killer with the glasses and all not that he wasnt anyway because he serially killed a lot of guys pretty ruthlessly too marton csokas also did a fine job representing a cool slick moriarty cross with the demon dude from supernatural his character was a bit all over the place and often there were times when the things you would expect his character to do didnt happen for example in the home scene where teddy visits mccall at his house if their respective characters were truly themselves then some things wouldve definitely have gone down during that interaction it left me feeling like they couldve ended the film then and there but decided to drag it out via a few thousand deaths and justice scenes also for the final home depot scene which as an action film i kind of expected chloe moretz was an okay teri she didnt get much screen time they had such a thick friendship for him to go through all that jazz but they only had the occasion of meeting up in the film three times which was kind of weird if you think about it but it was good that the focus wasnt just on a girl it seems as though in this film women and men are equalized the other characters didnt really seem very important to the plot just extras dying the cinematography was decent i mean they got the actions parts pretty good but the slow scenes felt more slow than they should have been i understand this is build up technique for tension but honestly for tensions scenes i personally would go for a straight one shot rather than flick over multiple camera shots to show many perspectives of one person being choked to death for example the first action scene was brilliant and i wished there was more of that equalisation but the remaining action scenes and sortof action scenes left a lot to be desired the final action sequence definitely dragged out for too long and it was not really known how many people nikolai had entered the building with and that made me feel quite an imbalance with what was going on especially since in the previous scenes they illustrated each character and their deaths if they died the final scene where nikolai versus mccall was way too short this whole rivalry the film built up between these two equalizers felt like it was for nothing as mccall obviously out equalized his adversary extremely quickly too unfortunately left me feeling incomplete especially after the scene where mccall directly threats nikolai in the restaurant the plot was pretty unrealistic the idea behind it was decent i guess with the whole moral obligations follow your heart served with the side of justice combo meal deal type of thing and i suppose it was fair that mccall did get roughed up once or twice during his altercations but to take down an entire enterprise and then immediately travel to russia to shut the whole thing down officially these guys must have been trained in cod or something really teris character was a nice trigger but the plot focused far too much time trying to create the relationship between her and mccall the script was pretty nice made the dialog flow very well straight to the point with a touch of melodrama during some certain monologues the conversations didnt seemed forced but the whole special prostitute meets special agent kind of thing was kind of fake feeling like in a book from the or something like pretty woman never existed or something since when do you make friends like that in diners nowadays and i assume this was as he was using a smart phone to take pictures and he was using a laptop to hack cameras plot holes why the hell did he have two houses did he know this thang was gonna happen how do you rig a surveillance system in your house with the wages from home depot how did he create an entirely new identification for himself when according to his cia friend he was dead wouldnt the cia have found out wouldnt his friend have been breaking protocol would the cia suspect something what with all the killings going on and suddenly a retired cia asks to see some files relating to the recent killings is the cia that chill why did the tanker company have no security surely he didnt as he is a sentimental character who believes and peace and justice why did the russian mobsters decide to kill mccall ruthlessly at the end when at the beginning they spent so much time trying to make it look like a clean death what rich russian mobsters cant afford silencers they couldnt have stationed the sniper from the other location outside of home depot they couldnt afford smoke bombs or the like even though they had night vision couldnt they afford thermal scopes he could have easily been taken out so many times all in all great film i enjoyed it i laughed would watch again provided i forgot what the film entailed which isnt going to be a problem two weeks from now,0.9988,1
unimpressive,curtisisasian,20 January 2015,5,this movie is a somewhat overly clichéd attempt to return denzel washington to his previous state of badassery its filled with relatively weak symbolism mediocre dialogue although denzel does have a few pretty badass lines the action is really just okay half of the killing happens offscreen and the rest is just not very entertaining the best fight scene is probably the first one a load of slowmo scenes that just dont cut it nowadays if youve heard the lonely island song cool guys dont look at explosions this is the where that idea came from even the villain is weak they even say hes an intelligent person but the entire movie is denzels character robert outsmarting him sure there are a few close callswhich lets face it you can guess the outcome but none of them were due to a clever ruse concocted by the enemy there is little semblance of intelligence in this movie theres nothing really special about the equalizer its not complex theres really no plot to be foiled and overall its just not really that entertaining if youre looking for a much more badass nobrainer modern action flick id suggest john wick even though they have a somewhat similar storyline,-0.8366,0

Just amazing,darkwizard404,27 April 2018,9,this movie was simply superb the plot is very simple yet manages to make a huge impact on the audience the director has shown that a simple plot can be made into a brilliant movie cheers to mr fuqua for that coming to the acting denzel washington was just too good in his role i believe no one else could have portrayed robert mccall any better in a movie than him the intensity that his character was supposed to possess was clearly shown chloegrace moretz as the teenage prostitute was also good in her small role the villain played by marton csokas was also good one of the best things about this movie are its themes which are dark gritty and violent the action scenes were very well done especially the climax scene in the warehouse another thing i loved is the concept of the movie denzel plays an excia special forces officer who left his job to live a quiet life as he promised his deceased wife but seeing a young girl in trouble he decides to get back in action and goes on a violent rampage against the russian mafia in a certain way this movie sends a great message to the society that there are still good people out there who are ready to help all those who are oppressed watching this movie will make you wish for the existence of someone like robert mccall in real life who would provide vigilante justice which is something the world desperately needs especially with all the atrocities being commited around the world on certain groups of people overall this is a great movie and a wonderful action thriller which also has a good story that the audience can enjoy and im eagerly waiting for the equalizer ii,0.9958,1
Denzel,aaronwilliams8,19 November 2021,7,so the main thing going for this movie is denzel washington yeah i could say that about some of his other movies as well but he is basically the only thing that really stands out in this generic film sure it has some cool scenes with denzel playing this badass but its nothing really knew in this type of genre the plot is about a man with a past that is seeking redemption and retribution he is a vigilante that puts the law into his own hands and handles things like the punisher but probably not as cruel when it comes to handling the bad guys mainly because he at least gives some of them chances before he gets his hands dirty i was able to sit through this but it isnt something i would watch again mainly because its just not that entertaining in my opinion and the character development is poorly constructed and that includes the plot as well it just didnt seem to flow that well marton csokas was good as the villain teddy but his character was poorly written and his character didnt seem to bring out his full potential as the villain decent job sort of building him up and nothing the only scene that actually stood out for me is when denzels character is sitting in front of the villain in the restaurant and they exchange words with one another sort of reminded me of a scene from heat overall though its a forgettable film,-0.8139,0

"And while this remake of 'The Equalizer' might not have the depth and symbolism that 'Training Day' did, it certainly is a fun action film.",bryank-04844,12 August 2015,6,this remake of an television show about a retired cia operative who now helps regular people in trouble has been in the works for quite some time i believe it was always going to star the impressive denzel washington but a few directors have been in and out of the directors chair including nicolas winding refn drive he bowed out a while ago and the studio asked antoine fuqua to helm the project which he accepted fuqua worked with washington on the oscar winning film training day which also earned washington an acting oscar that movie was a raw and gritty film about a couple of police detectives working the mean streets of los angeles it had many layers of depth and character development alongside its violent action scenes well dont go into the equalizer expecting that instead go in expecting a s nic cage type of action film complete with slow motion shots of denzel walking away from big explosions the only thing that was missing were john woos white doves flying out into the sky when fuqua turned up the action beats thats not to say this movie is bad in any way shape or form it isnt in fact its quite good and entertaining if you walk in expecting a fun action movie with denzel kicking all sorts of ass we meet denzels character robert mccall as he is heading to work at his job at a home depot type place as a general employee he is a nice and fun guy around his coworkers and even tries to help them out in life when he can he spends his evenings at a local diner reading novels eating pie and watching the local vagrants come in on their break one of them is teri chloe grace moretz a prostitute who is constantly being beat by her johns and pimprussian mob underboss well robert wont stand for this aggression and tries to make sure this doesnt happen again but when teri ends up in the hospital die to a severe beating robert heads over to the pimp who did this and we see robert turn into a super soldier of sorts who brutally takes out five guys in under a minute once the higher ups in the russian mob hear about this robert is forced to start taking out all assassins that are trying to get to him he even enlists the help of his former colleagues at one point with cameos from bill pullman and melissa leo which give a backstory to roberts past and how important he was to the usa everything culminates back at roberts workplace the home depot where all hell breaks loose as robert sets these insane and violent traps around the store for his attackers this is a straightforward action film with all the genre beats that come with it twists and all denzel is years old but man he kicks ass like a healthy year old its brutal raw and unrelenting and while this remake of the equalizer might not have the depth and symbolism that training day did it certainly is a fun action film that is thrilling and highly entertaining,-0.4623,0
Not Denzel's Best movie ever but it was okay.,nicktusk-95591,13 October 2019,7,movie starts off in the life of denzels character mr mccall at first the audience will see him as a single older black dude who works at home depot or in the movie its called home mart anyhow he apparently helps out some heavyset co worker get his security license and is also providing knowledge and wisdom to his two youth co workers also he appears friendly and polite to all his female coworkers as well the plot delves a little deeper as we learn his character cant sleep and has insomnia and spends most his nights at a diner drinking tea and reading books it is there where he befriends a young russian prostitute and she gives him a cd of her singing and befriends him back later something happens to the girl without too much spoilers she is a prostitute for the russian mob he goes after them out of revenge for hurting her the plot it was very bland and mild it sort of is intriguing but most of it you will say to yourself eh its been done before action sequences again nothing special here the ending part to the movie is very cool and antone fuqua uses his typical cinematography with water dripping every where the sound track has a song by moby that we all know and a song by eminem at the ending credits keep in mind this movie came out in and most of you have seen it already my basic review is this its an okay feel good movie but doesnt do denzels great acting abilities any justice like i said the plot is very bland as we later find out in the movie that he was an excia assassin and left his wife due to the agency its never really explained why he goes after the russians considering they didnt kill the girl nor does it go into detail about his connection to the cia the antagonist who is the ruthless russian mafias lieutenant is assigned to find and track down and kill mr mccall for a bigger russian boss located in moscow called pushkin played by an actor i like named marton csokas the russians are in bed with some corrupt cops as well who work in boston and one is played by david harbour hellboy denzels character tracks him down and is able to use him to flush out the remaining mobsters the fat guy is played by johnny skourtis an unknown actor who does a pretty good job of being denzels side kick as he always seems to have one in all his movies denzels character is trying to help him lose weight to become a security guard for the home depot company they work at and denzel is constantly finding him trying to smuggle potato chips in his healthy tuna sandwiches the girl is played by chloe grace moretz another unknown at least by me who actually survives but unfortunately her friend isnt so lucky who falls victim to marton the antagonist character all in all like i said its an okay movie reason being is denzel washington you expect the movie to be great and when it isnt it is somewhat of a disappointment however like i said the movie doesnt disappoint but isnt great either just flat out okay,0.9941,1
Obama against Russia?,tulgabat,16 December 2014,3,this movie probably invested by usa government hahahaha obama killing russian oligarchs by his hand drill against machine guns and killing them and taking their tonnes of money of their storage and finally killed putin what a poor story and never seen like this stupid movie with ratings and also from denzin washington dont understand why people giving on this piece of the story is unclear who is that professional man and howecome one person doing karate against fully armored professional killers and showing that usa cops are too stupid and nothing can do and obama is too old for that fast movement against youngsters it is like superman wanted to proof how usa black man strong for the russians very unsatisfied and wasted whole hours like this stupid movie this rating is just overrated,-0.9905,0
Good vigilante thriller,SkullScreamerReturns,18 March 2020,7,this was a rather nice surprise and one of the better action movies ive seen from past decade it has a good balance of slower drama parts and rough action senes but it all ties together and the tension keeps building all the time denzel washington is great as the lead guy hes tough and cool but also has a subtle emotional quality behind his serious face the supporting characters are also ok though they dont have very much to do theres just enough something to make you care about the characters now comes the minorspoiler section the main characters past is not explained very much which bothered me a bit but in the end i also felt that it was a nice mystery to be left open but the problem is that the movie starts in a rather serious and realistic way but then its revealed that this ordinary guy has some secret super commando skills why is it that every time in movies when a main character runs into a criminal gang he just happens to be some war veteran former cop or agent or something well maybe thats because were in an action movie i just felt like the humble personality of the character didnt completely fit together with his overpowered combat skills overall its a good movie recommended for anyone who likes thrillers about a renegade guy seeking justice against a whole bunch of bad guys,0.9718,1
"Based on the 1985 TV show, Denzel Washington is an ex.. special something who helps crime victims by charmingly killing bad people.",NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,12 July 2016,8,the equalizer is based on an tv show and now its back for a new generation a new take a new and awesome i might add action film directed by mister antoine fuqua training day southpaw the film follows robert played by denzel washington training day american gangster robert is a man of a mysterious origin who believes he has put the past behind him dedicates himself to creating a quiet new life he works at a home depot takes public transportation goes to the same restaurant every night to drink tea even though he brings his own tea bag so really he is just ordering hot water reads his book talks to an underage prostitute named teri played by chloe grace moretz kick ass let me in and doesnt bother anyone until the russian mob get violent and abuse teri thats when denzel decides he needs to get back in his old ways and deliver a fresh can of whoop ass to the bad guys denzel washingtons performance in this film is one of the best performances ive seen him do in a long time his character is brutal badass charming has a hunger for justice and overall this is a very cool character this is how i imagined the punisher in his older years antoine fuqua really knows how to mingle a magnificent action movie its action packed stylized and some very cool shots throughout this film denzel washington really is like a modern day stylized superhero did you notice he wears the same type of shirt throughout the movie that might as well be his superhero costume spray paint a big bat logo on it and he is good to go accordingly my only complaint about the film is it could have been trimmed down to a shorter movie also the villains could have been fleshed out a little bit better they come off as typical foreign villains weve seen before so these are my final bitchin buddha thoughts on the equalizer a good action movie that has a cool character scenes and a cool story my only complaint is the films running time is a little long and with a story like this it doesnt need to be this long i believe antoine fuqua is a good director and i believe this is a good film in my opinion the equalizer earns a this review is brought to you by boogie buddha and remember dont just get down but get boogie thank you all for reading and viewing and i hope you have an amazing day as always,0.9719,1
It Bothers Me To Say That I Liked It,Mike_Yike,8 April 2024,7,many years ago i saw two maybe three of the death wish sagas starring charles bronson much more recently there are the taken movies with liam neeson i mention these film franchises because the equalizers are much the same albeit the equalizers have a bigger budget and are better than those death wish films still all of these movies have to do with bad guys who need to be killed with the general theme of the movies being how is the hero going to kill them what innovative method is going to be used i have wondered if denzel washington is proud of the equalizer movies thats a real and not a rhetorical question im sure hes making a fortune on them i cant criticize washington for making them because i like these movies they give me my quota of fake violence some of which is so absurd it is chuckleoutloud funny anyway thats my take on the equalizer dont feel bad if you in some manner actually enjoy some villain getting impaled on the pointed edge of a corkscrew he was a villain after all,-0.9084,0
will inspire you,gabrielmarquesfranco,17 February 2023,10,great movie the character of robert mccall denzel washington played by the greatest actor of all time in my humble opinion is inspiring the antagonist teddy or nicolai itchenko marton csokas is also worthy of good reviews great acting robert mccall is a principled disciplined man who cares and is always willing to help people even if it puts his life at risk the way mr mccall advises the character teri and makes all the necessary sacrifices to show her that it is possible to be whoever she wants to be that is the most beautiful thing about this film i believe that everyone in the world should have such a person in their life,0.9823,1
"""You are what you are in this world""",gbacquet,25 December 2014,7,if that line from the movie were true denzel washington and antoine fuqua are the embodiment of it in the equalizer those familiar with antoine fuquas filmography know that he likes it gritty dark and violent but also that his films are very much characterdriven thats what separates this film from your average action revengetype movie denzel washington is robert mccall a man with a mysterious past who strikes an unlikely relationship with a young prostitute chloe gracemoretz this relationship and what comes of it will make his past come clashing with his desire to leave it behind washington plays a broken man at odds with his choices and its no surprise how well he can play it after all hes done it before but make no mistake this is not man on firethis film is much slower and takes its time exploring both the character and his choices which as the film progresses seem logical and consistent with what youve seen it doesnt have tony scotts flare and visual tricks but its much smoother less distracting slicker and atmospheric the action scenes are mostly well done and marton czokas plays a worthy adversary to denzels mccall yes some of the dialog is a tad cliché and some lines seem out of place but it wont pull you out of the movie this is not a movie about great dialog and it certainly wont win an oscar for best screenplay its strengths lie in the exploration of the character his motivations and inner conflicts as well as in the creation of a great visual atmosphere totally adhoc with the story in the end thats really what the film is about a man his past which is never entirely revealed but does help to understand him and how it will affect his future decisions i did say mostly well done because for most of the film the actions scenes were actually plausible and added realism to the film whereas the final showdown does go over the topits fun mind youbut highly unrealistic when you see it youll know why one additional aspect id like to highlight is the soundtrack which contains songs by eminem and zach hensey among others and really adds to the general dark atmosphere of the film sometimes songs in films are badly chosen and kill the moodits the complete opposite here they enhance it and help heighten emotions im not a huge fan of fuquas previous films but i did enjoy training day the replacement killers and shooter for what they were this movie is a step up in pace story and visuals while keeping some of his trademarks if you like dark wellpaced gritty thrillers or denzel walking around with a broken gaze and nothing to lose this film is definitely for you,0.9386,1
There are So Many Actors But There Is Only One Denzel,mohamed_tarek,26 September 2014,10,another masterpiece for the one only denzel some actors act but few like denzel wake up in the morning and being themselves in front of a camera the equalizer is a great movie made only for denzel his performance is just brilliant the story is wellwritten the choice of actors and actresses was great the humor and action is well put and with the right amount if you are a fan of denzel and who isnt you gonna love this movie if you want to relive the experience of man on fire then the equalizer is your chance to do that its a must see movie its always a pleasure to see denzel antoine work together like they did in training day i believe there will be a sequel to this great and amazing movie,0.9936,1
Clichê fun movie,diegosolamito,30 August 2021,6,who doesnt want to see denzel in his usual role a super human hero it sells there was no effort to avoid the predictability of the plot there was great effort on thinking in each killing and the camera work at those scenes this was great here denzel lives a batmansherlock holmes mix role oh hes so perfect it makes me dizzy butok that is what it intends to be right it gives what is expected its fun,0.9415,1
Fuqua's Best Work in Some Time,IMDbommie,28 September 2014,10,i have an onagainoffagain relationship with fuqua films ive grown increasingly disenchanted with his posttraining day films and ive been waiting for one to rekindle my interest despite really liking the tv spotstrailers for the equalizer i still had my reservations about seeing the equalizer but im glad that i did because its the fuqua film ive been waiting for synopsis denzel washington plays robert mccall an ex governmentcia agent its never explicitly specified what he did only implied now living an ostensibly honest life in boston massachusetts hes been able to successfully distance himself from his past life all the while helping and assisting those who he is friends with after getting to know a young aspiring singeralina played by moretzwho hangs out at a diner that mccall frequents he realizes that shes involved with some shady people mccall decides to help her next but doing so not only makes him confront his past it begins to unravel a thread that he may come to regret ever tugging in the first place review directing cinematography surprisingly deft behind the camera fuqua shifts his directing style in the equalizer clearly taking inspiration from and watchmen director zack snyder at times the film itself looks fantastic each shot is crisp and sharp mauro fiore worked with fuqua on training day and tears of the sun but also with peter berg on his film the kingdom i may have had gripes with some of fuquas past few films but ive always admired his cinematography and this notion still holds with the equalizer fiore does a great job as familiar boston settings almost act as complimentary characters in each scene writing i had watched this film a week after seeing liam neesons kindasortsimilar a walk among the tombstones which was a massive disappointment to me solely because the of the writing im glad to say that the equalizer doesnt suffer from this problem richard wenk does a commendable job of introducing us to mccall and revealing his quirks to the audience every character in the film is flawedeven mccallyet fuqua and wenk are able to translate them to the screen with both delicacy and intrigue i have only two gripes with the writing first as some other reviews have astutely noted moretzs character is unfortunately relegated to a massive supporting role i found this to be an utter shame as she portrayed alina with such a tenderness and vulnerabilityi was really disappointed that she had probably less than minutes of screen time my other writing related issue stems from what ive dubbed end of watch syndrome for anyone who has seen david ayers film end of watch youll know that while a good movie its highly farfetched simply because so much happens to the two protagonists in so little time this happens a little bit in the equalizer as mccallwho had apparently lived a normal life since his retirement from the cia up until the beginning of this film suddenly has a string of nearlyunbelievable actionpacked encounters in about a hour span none of which are actually related to each other but i can suspend my disbelief this is a film after all and that is the agreement we make as an audience it was just a little too unbelievable but hardly a dealbreaker although if extra terrestrials some how wound up in the film then that would be a different story musical score im a bit of an audiophile and i contend that a fantastic soundtrack is one of the biggest assets any film can boast literally from the opening scene of the equalizer i knew that the film was in great hands musically it wasnt until the credits that i realized why they were able to nab the great harry gregsonwilliams the first two narnia films and kingdom of heaven among many many others oddly enough hes also scored a number of denzel films man on fire deja vu pelham unstoppable for some films the music is just there its really nothing more than filler but the equalizer benefits greatly from gregsonwilliams subtle touches uplifting at times and dramatic when needed the score for this film is one of the better ones i can remember for big hollywood films this year probably right behind tyler bates work on guardians of the galaxy final thoughts denzel is great as always but i also want to give proper credit to marton csokas who plays the main antagonist his chemistry with denzel washington is just a pleasure to witness its a shame hes always some twisted villain in the majority of his roles in the end the equalizer has something for everyone attention grabbing music great characters an aesthetically awesome look fantastic acting interesting story and pulsepounding action id highly recommend this film to anyone especially anyone who lives in the boston area it can be great fun to see landmarks and areas on film that you see every day and another plus is that its only in so that you dont have to get suckered into the inflated prices these days to be honest you dont really need to read a review about the film to know what its about its denzel being a badass weve all seen this before havent we especially given that denzels done man on fire but if you still have doubts let me put it this way i can think of a thousand things that would be a much bigger waste of even if you end up not liking the film,0.9988,1
The Equalizer Review,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,8 October 2014,7,my thoughts i know this is based off the tv show that was around in the s i also remember watching at least some episodes but it was not a family staple in my household so i can say that i am not coming in biased in any way to the movie remake this is the type of movie that when it is said and done with if you really start thinking about it you will start poking holes in itnot to say that that is a bad thing what the equalizer is giving us is something of a slow burn movie in my opinion we follow the day to day life of robert mccall denzel washington working at home mart helping a coworker attain his dream and visiting a diner in the middle of the night due to not being able to sleep we then come to learn that robert mccall is not who everyone thinks he is he is a man with a past that no one can seem to uncover the action scenes in this movie are really well put together they have a mixture of the hyper sense of the sherlock holmes movie with there own spin on things robert mccall is just trying to live his life but when he starts seeing people that he cares about in trouble it reawakens his old life style and he cant help but help those people out it is an enjoyable movie and very watchable but there is not a lot there when you think about it it is really very cookie cutter in what it presents to the viewer like i stated earlier once you start thinking more indepth about the movie the more you can poke holes in it especially when it comes to the teri chloë grace moretz story line and one thing that people in the theater seemed to really love but i was kind of disappointed in was a battle between robert mccall and one of the bad guys that was worked up to be such a bad ass the fight was satisfying but i was expecting so much more from it and it did end in the way that the tv show ended my recommendation we are moving out of the blockbuster season and we are not going to be getting great movies every weekend the equalizer is a good movie to check out if you are looking for an action movie where you can turn of your brain and just enjoy it if not wait util the dvd comes out,0.9761,1
Political movie...,taditux,6 October 2014,3,i give this movie for effects and sound track there was no story actors dont have personalitys and worst thing with this movie brain washing we got russians as bad guys ohh really we have black guy as hero which will save the day it cant be more political then this and on top of that main actor is steven seagal in black guy bodyi hate steven seagal movies they are so dumb always sorry if i offend someone i would gladly take my time back and do nothing nothing is better then watching this movie,-0.8578,0
"OK, my love for Denzel aside, storyline, is pretty average",bowmiyaofficial,5 November 2014,7,oh denzel how i love thee once again you charmed me with your delivery of being intelligent cool and morally correct the role you play is defo a good look for you and damn you do it so well teri chloe grace moretz a young prostitute who works for a infamous russian gangster gets saved by robert mccall denzel washington a seemingly quiet and peaceful fatherly guy turns out he can kick ass pretty well and so achieves justice in the end fuquas style delivers a good spectacle with focus on roberts supernatural talents and combat there is a scene that is reminiscent of denzel in man on fire where he walks away from a blanketing explosion with swag and thats always jawdropping cool lol some disturbing and gruesome deaths to witness but they are gracefully executed and over in seconds skillz booyeh also want to mention how much new zealands marton csokas reminded me of kevin spacey in this film themlooks the audience are given a happy ending and i was fed hope that there really are heros like robert out there,0.9904,1
Denzel is a BADASS,ryanlitt07,30 September 2014,8,i went into this movie with an open mind as denzel is ageing and this movie didnt have much hype i left throughly impressed and would go back and watch it again denzel plays a very calm respectful and polite older man who frequently visits the local coffee shop where he reads books and chats with a young girl who is into some pretty negative stuff in her life prostitution he acts as a father figure to her and tries guiding her in the right direction in life just as this happens sht hits the fan and thats where the action picks up you find out quickly that he possesses some special skills basically this is the type of movie you cant help but get behind and cheer for the good guy he exacts revenge on everyone who does him or his friends wrong he does so in a very savage way and uses odd weapons to get the job done rarely uses a gun throughout the movie youre shown how great of a human being he is as he constantly tries helping less fortunate people get ahead in life the villains are cast very well and give you the impression that theyre no one to mess around with and surprise you with intelligence however a villain is a villain and you know how that ends if you want to see a truly badass movie with a ballsy tough guy this is the movie its not action all of the time but thats what makes it great lots of buildup to the ass whoopings,0.5308,1
A Denzathon all the way,ramnath-p,19 July 2018,7,this is a thriller saved from b movie mediocrity if not for the standalone performance of denzel washington he virtually carries the movie forward by the weight of his performance outshining all other characters including the main antagonist its a must watch for every action movie fan out there,0.3182,1
One of the best vigilante movies I've seen,jtindahouse,24 December 2014,9,how could anyone not like a vigilante movie its surprising to me hollywood doesnt make more of them considering they always seem to be well liked and successful plus the formula is simple enough to create then you simply find the right actor and boom box office success the first vigilante movie that comes to mind for most people id imagine would be die hard then for the younger generation id imagine it to be taken and possibly a few of the older generation because it was pretty good and now im telling you once enough people have seen the equalizer itll be right up there amongst the other big guns because it is very very good the most important ingredient of all to the vigilante genre has to be the star bruce willis was perfect in his role liam neeson was even better in his role and now here we have denzel washington one of the coolest actors in hollywood for an old man hes he absolutely nailed it first of all youd never guess he was i believe he worked out very hard for the role secondly its his demeanor throughout that defines the character hes so in control so calm and collected that never once do we feel he could be in the slightest bit of danger from these ragtag russian gangsters and unfortunately therein lies probably the only downfall in the equalizer perhaps hes simply too in the control the entire time it makes for a lot of fun no doubt about it but somewhere in those hours and minutes you have to have your hero in a precarious position where it seems all is lost only for him to miraculously escape theres a scene where you could argue that was the case but i dont think it was enough thats the only criticism though i could find in this very fine film,0.8565,1

Simply superb,Eddie_weinbauer,1 November 2014,10,the equalizer wow just finished watchin this and it was great first i gotta say im no big fan of denzel the movies ive seen by him that has been enjoyable have been few and far between for a role like this i would actually have chosen jason statham but i guess denzels name draws more people to the movies but denzel did a superb job i was truly and toughly entertained and that is a long time since ive been chloë grace moretz plays extremely well for her young age and i think she will go far i really liked her performance she handled the act of playing a prostitute really well for her young age the only thing that draws the movie slightly down is the whole cat and mouse game that goes on all through the movie they need to come up with a new way to make these type of movies without the cat and mouse game its been used through and through and its get tire some an stupid after while i mean why mess around with the lower level goons and minions when you all the time have the means and opportunity to go direct to the top and cut of the head of the snake but its and excellent action packed movie i truly recommend it,0.9915,1
Pleasantly Surprised...Spoilers,kenpo1980,26 May 2015,7,first let me just say that i was a big time fan of the television version of the equalizer in the but the only similarity is that the characters share the same name denzel washington plays robert mccall a super organized and friendly loner that works in what appears to be a home depot type of store his past which is clearly working as a cia operative who was believed killed haunts him so he cant sleeps and spends his evening at a local coffee shop reading and socializing with a very young attractive prostitute teri played by chloe graze moretz after teri is assaulted and hospitalized by her pimp played by david meunier justified fans will recognize him mccall proceeds to go on a killing rampage which starts a war with a powerful russian king pin the story then follows a by the numbers actionkill fest that leads pretty much where you expect to go but what makes it work are excellent performances by everyone in the cast and the tight story telling there is no chaff in this film and it does not pretend to be anything than what it is a great way to spend a couple of hour being entertained and not thinking if you are not a fan of pretty graphic violence you may want to avoid this one,0.9765,1
A popcorn flick which could have been so much more...but still fun though.,j-madej,23 September 2014,8,who does not like denzel washington not many people the fact is that there is something really cool about the characterizations he creates which often are underplayed and stick in our memory for a long time after the viewing he likes to transform himself from character to character but always leaves that groove walk that became in some way his signature the problem with hollywood film industry is that once something worked in the past it will be repeated production companies almost never want to take a risk with the original projects it is better to find some old movie or tv show and make a new spin off based on the old concept this is where the equalizer fits in on paper very enjoyable and existing triller that is based on s tv series originally starring edward woodward russell crowe was originally attached to star as robert mccall eventually the role went to denzel and probably with better effect the only minus is that denzel has done this type of part on more than one occasion tony scotts man on fire immediately comes to mind also safe house out of time as well as to some extend training day this last one was directed by antoine fuqua who also happens to be director of the equalizer sadly the genius of training day did not follow him here even though he did the best he could with the material presented to him in the script by richard wenk adopted from tv show ideas of michael sloan and richard lindheim mccall denzel washington is a former black ops commando who has faked his death to live a quiet life in boston we find out about that though half way through the movie when he comes out of his selfimposed retirement to rescue a young girl teri chloë grace moretz he finds himself face to face with ultraviolent russian gangsters as he serves vengeance against those who brutalize the helpless mccalls desire for justice is reawakened if someone has a problem the odds are stacked against them and they have nowhere else to turn mccall will help he is the equalizer i wish the script would have been better because there is truly potential here with the cast that has been assembled every movie needs a good antagonist and marton csokas as teddy offers a good counterpart to denzels character his mix of sophistication and sadism offers well needed dose of balance between humanity mccall and evil russian mafias cleaner teddy the scene between mccall and teddy in the restaurant when they come face to face is one of the best and most intense acting wise watching that scene brought to mind another iconic scene form movie the heat between pacino and deniro very enjoyable indeed full of depth and internal dialog specially played in close up where the eyes do the talking the action scenes are shot in manner that resemble bit tony scotts style of filmmaking in fact the whole film stylistically might have been inspired by work of the late director before every action scene mccall as a gimmick start his stop watch and estimates how long it will take him to kill subjects with the shortest amount of time he choreographs the attack based on the threat and objects that he uses as weapons with minimal amount of movement despite of the unoriginal story and perhaps little bit cliché ending i did enjoy the equalizer for what it was a popcorn flick which could have been so much more but then again money roles hollywood and judging by response of the audience tonight the equalizer will make good boxoffice i am just hoping for denzel washington that he will not get type casted with this type of roles which he always does really well but here he did not have much to do in terms of his character development though he was still ice cool as always for more of my reviews please go to,0.9951,1
Great movie - but should be classed in Sci-Fi section,mr_iceman,14 December 2014,6,i know this wasnt based on a true story but the producer was silly to portray excia operative to be able to take down an entire russian mafia and take care of corrupt cops while stopping the occasional burglary at the local home improvement diy robert mccall makes the swat team look like like the rugrats the movie started off incredible the first were captivating however the plot thickened the film got progressively worse like a crescendo it put rambo to shame as it amassed weight on the bullshit scale at one point i really wondered whether the entire state really needed any more police perhaps batman was enough if you can watch this with an open mind where anything is possible then this movie is great if youre too analytical then dont as you would be disappointment,0.5162,1
What a garbage,epronine-888-618463,31 December 2014,1,i am speechless how omg how this flick got above on imdb what an insult not to russians but to anyone with enough gray matter in their skulls cliché on cliché we have seen this way too many times all of it and given the latest antirussian crusade by our lessthancompetent administration this movie apparently is supposed to make good folks to feel some righteous anger towards those savages denzel definitely could do better here without getting in to perilous nicky gages game could be a career ender for some i am not even starting about that ridiculous tattoos and accents yet another reason to stop watching anything mainstream,-0.7543,0
good action movie,gonion4230,13 October 2014,7,this was a very good movie but a little too long the setup was slow but i knew what was coming so was willing to wait it out denzel washingtons character is a former ciatype who now lives alone and works at a home improvement store we get to see a lot maybe too much of that store luckily the action in this movie finally started and it eventually became explosive and nonstop very fun to watch many of the characters were pretty onenote with the exception of the villain and chloe moretz as a prostitute those two were very good the other characters simply served the purpose of the story which basically was to let denzel washington beat people up and outsmart them single handedly you can see this was set up to have a sequel,0.956,1
A cinematic marvel spoilt by a simplistic story line,ayoreinf,28 September 2014,8,it seems that all the worlds problems with crime couldve been solved if only we had robert mccall on the other end of the line this unstoppable force of nature could bring in world peace in no time and if we gave him some more leeway im sure hed solve world hunger and global warming too which is plainly speaking just a shame the film as is is superbly shot and acted it uses the cinematic image like very few others in the industry do and previous encounters with antoine fuqua proves that he simply has this great understanding of the visual aspects of movie making the replacement killers and king arthur are just two obvious examples the original series was superb because in its edward woodward version mccalls limitation were always part of the story he was super because he never tried to overcome a roomful of armed gangsters he strategized his way around such circumstances and never tried to solve the entire american problem with the mob whats the point of translating tv masterpieces of the past to the big screen if you miss its core point,0.8496,1
"Stupid, but what the heck; fun to watch",angelsunchained,31 January 2021,7,nothing new here one man army with superhuman abilities rights the ills of society denzel gives a likeable performance but his age makes the fight scenes truly ridiculous however despite the violence it is all good brutal fun,0.7777,1
"When you Pray For Rain, you Have to Deal with the Mud too",CowherPowerForever,28 September 2014,8,the equalizer starring denzel washington is a nicely written story that is based on the hit television show of the same name starring edward woodward which ran for four seasons while i never had the chance to watch the television series before the film i truly believe this hardcore action film did it justice if you want a hard r action film with over the top violence and fantastic acting this is the film for you the following is my review of the equalizer the film was written by richard wenk who recently wrote such films as the expendables and the mechanic so his experience is basically in minimal story action films frankly though in this film that doesnt show at all the characters are written greatly for the most part and the depth of the characters carries the film the story follows robert mccalldenzel washington as he is a man with a mysterious past and we learn a little about that past as the story follows along mccall has been laying low and working at a home improvement store as bad events break out around him his past experience finally get its calling once more mccall delivers so much mayhem in this film and without spoiling the movie i cannot correctly described the mayhem mccall brings to the bad guys in this film though i will not be delivering those spoilers the film has many slow parts to it if you walk into the movie expecting action non stop throughout the majority of the film you will leave disappointed however if you can hold judgement until the film is completely over you will find a fantastic action film in the slower moving scenes of the film the acting really pays off so overall wenk delivers a solid story will an amazing pay off for us true action fans the film was directed by antoine fuqua who is well known for such films as training day shooter and the big hit of olympus has fallen while this film doesnt have the pacing of olympus has fallen the action when it does pop up is fierce and close to stomach turning there are a good bit of nicely innovative death scenes to leave you wanting more as you leave the theater with only a few major action scenes fuqua brings some nice camera work in the close combat fighting scenes while i cannot say the effort is perfect if you go to the theater expecting a fun action film with tons of violence then you will greatly enjoy your time during this film as i mentioned above the film does slow down as the story builds up with great acting from denzel washington chloë grace moretz marton csokas and david harbour the slower story building scenes are well worth watching if you enjoy some character driven elements denzel always dominates the roles he is in and while he goes a step up in this film i really felt marton csokasteddy plays a fantastic bad guy even if he is written somewhat inept at times overall fuqua delivers some amazing fun with the equalizer and fans of fun action and great acting will really enjoy his efforts the film was composed by harry gregsonwilliams who has recently scored such films as total recall and cowboys aliens i really enjoy a score that adds amazing depth and the score from harry gregsonwilliams is fantastic when the action picks up towards the end of the film there is a wonderful piece that played and it honestly got me at the edge of my seat during the nail biting scene if you really enjoy a nice score with your film the effort harry gregsonwilliams delivers is top notch in this film overall if you enjoy some action fun this is clearly the film for you the film has its faults and could be considered boring at times as the film has a good bit of character driven dialogue some may consider that a minus but with such an amazing cast of actors you barely even notice that the film features a lot of over the top action scenes via hand to hand combat and some interesting death scenes which should get even the most picky fans out to the theater frankly if you are reading this review i highly recommend this film to everyone there is no reason to miss this film it was that amazing and enjoyable i also want to touch on the imax version of the film as this is the version i watched for a ticket price of fifteen dollarsin my area could be higher or lower in your area the extra money is not really worth it unless your theaters other screens are subpar this imax version as usual adds amazing depth with the sound however since the film was not actually shot using imax cameras the image doesnt live up to imax films that were actually shot with imax cameras i would say it is personal preference but with tickets in imax costing so much you might want to save the extra five dollars or so unless you can get a discount showing,0.9972,1
Watch out for Denzel Washington,andrewmerritt-31652,8 January 2020,6,the equalizer stars denzel washington and is directed by antoine fuqua who directed training day which also starred denzel washington denzel washington plays a hitman who wants to lead a normal life but after an innocent girl played by chloe grace moretz ends up in the hospital by some russian gangsters he decides to take matters in his own hands we dont really know what denzel did before he decided to live a normal life but from what i saw it looked like he was a hitman and i like how he portrayed the different personalities to this person the movie was a little too long for my taste because it focused on his vigilante personality while at the same time dealing with the russian gangsters but what i really enjoyed was how he goes to an ordinary innocent man to an assassin when people mess with the things he loves the most hes not necessary lonely he likes helping people and he tries his best to leave his past behind and the concept of having someone go from innocent to hitman is very well acted by denzel but this is where the movie has its faults for one thing chloe grace moretz doesnt have a lot of screen time and i felt that they couldve done so much more with this character so we could understand the pain and suffering she went through the main antagonist is the other problem he tries so hard to be scary and intimidating that it almost comes off as laughable because weve seen this happen in so many movies that he doesnt really give us anything to work with this movie is more of a spy movie than a revenge movie as it is mostly a cat and mouse and also feels like a hitman video game than anything else so overall im not saying that its a bad movie it was average with a protagonist that was likeable but there were some pieces that didnt fit together and thats where it went wrong,0.9391,1
"A man who has retired from working for the government finds his work family threatened, as well as this young woman who he tries to give a little faith to.",Amari-Sali,28 September 2014,8,trigger warnings depictions of torture and up close murders it can be argued that when it comes to black actors who are well established like denzel washington will smith samuel l jackson and forest whitaker that they all have found a certain comfort zone in their acting choices however while on paper it may make seeing them in similar roles over and over bland while viewing the movie you often are reminded why they are allowed this amount of comfort in the first place for while many will compare this film to man on fire which honestly it only has similarities to since it is denzel going on a rampage to save a white girl that is where the comparisons begin and end characters story robert denzel washington works at home depot and has found himself to be the father figure around the place the young dudes idolize him and want to know what he did before working there the women find him attractive and he treats them all with respect a bit of charm and whether asked or not he will help them anyway possible like with ralphie johnny skourtis he helps him go from working the floor to being home depot security and then with teri real name alina chloe grace moretz he helps her believe in herself as well as give her a second chance something which isnt easy to do for with teri being young beautiful and worth a lot of money her pimp slavi david meunier doesnt want to let her go so robert tries to help her thing is as robert tries to help her he gets involved with the whole business which got teri to america in the first place meaning he has to climb the chain in order to regain any sense of peace in his life leading to the main story of the film which deals with robert taking on the russian mafia headed by vladimir pushkin vladimir julich a wellconnected gangster and his enforcer fixer teddy marton csokas but as well trained and talented as robert is he does show signs of aging leading you to wonder in his quest to free one girl from human trafficking how will he ultimately find peace with a bullet in the head but her free with the snakes head cut off and him going back to being just an unknown face or will he find himself without peace for as he tries to climb the ladder those he loved and wanted to protect end up falling off the roof praise in this film washington reminds you why his career spans over years and why he is considered a legend in the film business for while the story as a whole doesnt do anything drastically new or different from films with a similar premise washington puts his mark on it in such a way that he leaves you feeling the genre has found a new standard to live up to for robert is a man who you can see is conflicted about what he does wants to create the sort of normalcy he sacrificed for most of his life but at the same time he cant stop being the man who takes care of people when in need be it this kid at work who wants to be something more than he is or this little girl who has lived a hard life but dreams that she can escape it and become better now as for the action elements of the movie truly if you are squeamish you may want to be careful with this one for this is a violent movie for with robert having this sherlock holmes robert downey jrs version of slowing down time to analyze things and then really going all out including using a wine opener to kill someone and us seeing the wine opener in the mouth of someone robert just stabbed in the jaw truly the film does get graphic and while washington deserves much praise i feel you must also praise csokas too for being a credible villain if just because his performance and the build of his character is so good you honestly think when him and washington go one on one there is a more likely chance of them both dying than washington being alive after their battle something which is hard to do since washington is at the point in his career where it almost feels like there wont be any surprises when it comes to his character he is either going to live until the end or somehow come up on top however csokas makes you question washingtons celebrity having an effect on whether robert will live or die criticism first and foremost im rather tired of russian villains with the names vladimir dmitri and just russian bad guys period its overdone and at this point feels kind of lazy though the film in itself is very basic and only elevated due to strong performances however if anyone else was casted as robert or teddy this film would probably be a straight to vod release mostly because as lovable as robert is you dont get any sort of concrete details about him you learn he worked for the government had a wife but pretty much that is where things end robert for the most part is as unknown to us in the end as he was in the beginning overall worth seeing between washington and csokas i feel future action crime thrillers need to take note for as previously noted this film takes all the basic elements very familiar to movie lovers and pushes the bar up leading to a worth seeing label from me,0.9972,1
Similar to Taken but with no strings attached. Expect a sequel if it does well $$ wise,acidnat,15 December 2014,7,rating it outta coz there are movies worse than the out of that came out and i have seen this year not a must watch at allbut entertaining almost always its like takenbut no family part of the storyinstead its random strangers the protagonist denzel knows better than the other people in the flick a better plot when thinking about sequels coz there might even be i only say its like taken coz its the action movie minus the usually accompanied humour denzel and liam arent bruce or arnie or the rock xd one thing that stands out is the hand to hand combat is almost real timeexcept the villain kill stands out quit noticeably otherwise slomo is used exclusively for explosions and crashes if youre bored on a drunk weekdayyou could watch this move skipping the initial mins and never think of a rerun but just be entertained,0.7605,1

"Long, boring, strung out with a plot that we've seen done better 1,000 times before.",jordant-12858,7 June 2015,2,this movie was very painful to watch youll find yourself waiting ages for action sequences that are very predictable and bland half of this movie is spent on small talk and self reflection guess who the bad guys are you guessed it the russian mob other than enemies filled with borderline racist stereotypes youll find yet another cliché exassassin turned regular guy turned vigilante protagonist this movie will continually figuratively give you the middle finger by withholding information from the viewer to the point where the movie wont even show you action sequences this film takes beyond what seems like an eternity to even establish who the protagonist is or anything about his past another thing this movie lacks in is plot stability youll repeatedly find yourself asking who are these guys where is he what is he even trying to accomplish do not be afraid to get up to use the restroom or cook food without pausing the movie because you more than likely wont miss anything important because this movie lacks any important material even the soundtrack for the main action sequence is boring and repetitive it is almost literally im not making this up comprised of one single piano key being struck the sole reason i gave this movie stars instead of is because of denzel washingtons acting,-0.9396,0
Very Good Action Thriller,martinrey-15593,30 January 2021,7,this is a slightly more toned down version of the john wick series not quite as intense as wick but it has its moments of gore and action washington is great in the lead and the badie played by csokas is convincingly nasty well recommend action movie,0.9175,1

Washington carries this film thanks to his particular set of skills,estebangonzalez10,17 October 2014,7,i am offering you a chance to do the right thing take it with the exception of training day which i absolutely loved antoine fuqua hadnt directed a film that merited much acknowledgement being able to team up with denzel washington once again definitely attracted many peoples attention towards this project but if they were expecting the equalizer to replicate the success of training day then theyll be disappointed because what they get with this film is a standard by the books action thriller it plays out like most revenge thrillers do and it follows the standard formula of the genre in such a way that you can easily predict the outcome of most of the film what the equalizer does have going for it however is the presence of denzel washington in the titular role playing a character with a particular set of skills washington is solid and he elevates this generic film in such a way that he manages to keep us entertained there is something cool about his character and he portrays that interior smoothness very well here his character may seem calm and friendly in the surface but when it comes to helping the weak there is no one who can serve them justice better than him his character will easily remind people of liam neeson in taken or even tom cruise in jack reacher although washingtons character is much more likable the film also takes its time to set things up and it works to the films advantage here i would even say the buildup is much stronger than the execution the stylized violence is also present in this fuqua film and i enjoyed the overall look of the film with the underlying score setting the tone the equalizer reminded me a lot of man on fire which was a film i really loved so if you were a fan of it as well you might want to check this out it is very similar in structure and i would go as far as saying that it has a superhero movie feel to it as well i have seen over films starring denzel washington and i yet havent seen one i disliked sure there were some average films he made but never have i been disappointed by his movies i know the equalizer isnt groundbreaking and i shouldnt have enjoyed it as much as i did because it is full of clichés but it was impossible for me to resist washingtons charm once again he gives a solid performance in this action thriller and he carries the film the female characters are all portrayed as victims here once again but chloe grace moretz sells her character very well she has some solid scenes with washington at the beginning of the film which help set the premise of the film melissa leo could have been the strongest female character in the film but she only has a brief appearance this is basically a one man show with washington personifying coolness marton csokas is set up as a pretty strong villain during the first half of the film but he could have been better used in the second half csokas is washingtons counterpart kind of like what the joker was to batman and the buildup to the faceoff is what works best in this film i had a great time with this action thriller despite all its flaws,0.9987,1
Chillingly good,Figgy66-915-598470,8 October 2014,9,october film of choice at the plaza dorchester tonight the equalizer believing he has found a quiet life in boston having put his military past behind him mccall denzel washington comes to the aid of a young girl he has befriended and suddenly finds himself taking on a large chunk of the russian mafia this film had quite a long slow start and i wondered where it was going for a while however as the pieces of the story came together you became aware of the complexities of mccalls character and the horrors he thought he had put behind him superbly acted by washington this character was a man of few words and he was chillingly inscrutable as he was facing down his foes if i had to complain about anything it was maybe to minutes too long but that is a minor gripe against what was a good film astonishingly powerful soundtrack right from the beginning would make good driving music turned up full on the open road,0.8074,1
"A bit slow and flawed, but OK.",forpassord,29 December 2021,6,not that much action in this action movie most of it is over in a few seconds except for towards the end of the movie but the movie is very slow for just as long in the beginning and much of the time in the middle seems to be there to pass some time in between the beginning and the end some thrilling sequences and some crime are in the movie so ok it has the claimed ingredients even if it could benefit from at least having more action at least one event with an electric drill that was rather unrealistic took place the usual misunderstanding about how electricity behaves in water was also found time for several episodes where people had guns close by but chose not to use them took place the worst case of them all took place at the last scene in the home mart alternative ways of doing things might look cool but they are not necessarily neither the smart or the effective way of doing things usually it is neither the movie was ok to watch even if i found it to be to slow for to much time so if you like action movies with more style than contents see this movie but if you have to have action from the beginning to the end find something else to watch,0.8593,1

Great action movie but climax disappoint,gkkxxsfrg,15 October 2021,6,it was a great movie with action packed performance but i was really disappointed with the climax it looked like makers were in haste to finish it off early also there were many scenes which were left for our imagination like encounter of hero with store thief and in climax finishing off all the bodyguards of russian mafia overall a good watch,0.823,1
poor,sotojomal,30 January 2015,1,well i am a very harsh movie critic i knew what to expect from this movie and my expectations were met which is not a good thing i think denzel is a great actor but this role does not fit him in my opinion the movie does not have much of a story basically one man goes out and seeks revenge for a wrongdoing that he witnesses logic was clearly not applied in this movie the fact that he eliminates targets in a matter of seconds no one can apparently touch this man as well so no suspense is built in that sense also many of the characters are very dull not much emotion is evoked by them and the audience knows very little about them i think the biggest problem with this film and many other films that follow the same trajectory is that they are bent on the cliché that the protagonist must always be victorious but that mold should be broken towards the end of this film a nikolai which in my opinion the actor played this role very well was eliminated in such a fashion that made this movie a dud for me denzel and this individual were like chess players they knew each others moves why not end it in a more competitive fashion there are a multitude of issues i personally have with this movie others may not see it in the same fashion,-0.8909,0
Enjoyable if not particularly memorable,andyajoflaherty,19 July 2020,7,based off the old edward woodward tv series of the same name the film follows ex intelligence agent robert mccall as he decides to help a young girl he meets in a cafe after she is beaten to a pulp by her russian mob employers things spiral from there as he doles out justice to all those he meets who prey on the helpless this is a pretty good action film with a great bad guy satisfying and visceral action scenes and of course denzel plays the character well the plot is servicable but the dialogue and characterisation could have been better overall its a decent watch but its not a film i think ill ever feel the need to see again,0.9377,1
"When you're a vigilante, it's tough to stay retired, I guess.",Geff,30 September 2014,8,the equalizer stars denzel washington as a man who tries to leave his past behind by faking his own death but life catches up with him he witnesses a young beautiful girl brutalized and enslaved by ultraviolent russian gangsters and decides that he has to come out of retirement he uses his blackops skills to kill everyone in his path despite his promise to his now dead wife to be good when youre a vigilante its tough to stay retired i guess on a scale of to as an action movie its a he can kill faster than a vampire and he times himself to see how fast he is it is a fantasy vigilante film and he gets revenge in supersuperhuman style you must suspend disbelief to enjoy it fully good film of its genre the audience got into it and were cheering in good humor,-0.9441,0
Everyone wants to know.....,FlashCallahan,28 December 2014,7,robert mccall works at the home mart store frequently helping his coworkers make better of themselves every night mccall goes to a diner and he befriends teenager teri who is a lady of the night one night her pimp slavi brutally beats her and she is hospitalised mccall goes to the russian restaurant where slavi is and offers money for her freedom slavi does not accept the offer so mccall kills him and his four bodyguards russian kingpin vladimir sends enforcer teddy to find who killed his men soon he finds that mccall is the one who killed the mobster and teddy begins a war against him the first thing you notice is that this has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the eighties series of the same name now if you can forgive its shortcomings and cashing in on a well known name its a perfectly perfunctory action movie with one of hollywoods biggest stars at present and fuqua knows how to direct action sequences its just a blooming shame he doesnt know how to trim a movie because this is at least half an hour too long and feels a little bloated at times even though denzel is the only reason to watch this we could have done without all the zen type stuff he does in this and many other films he is in you know the calm soothing monologues about life and the past that seem to go on for ages and instead of drawing you toward the character more pulls you away from the narrative moretz is in it at the beginning to trigger his revenge switch and then pops up at the end to show him that all his equalising was worth it because she reads books and wears no more make up the action is relentless and pretty brutal and even though the first set piece reminded me of the slow motion bit in spiderman the final showdown in the hardware store harks back to the exploitative slasher movies of the eighties so all in all its nothing groundbreaking way too long and just a showcase for denzel but he does walk away from an explosion in slow motion thats always worth a watch,-0.5692,0
The ultimate action thriller,kmorris125,4 October 2014,9,denzel in a word is just brilliant and genuine in every scene he owns it this is just an all around edgy feel good thriller theres the bonus of a good guy having to do some very bad things in the name of justice hes trying to mind his own business and the cruel world just keeps reeling him in and forcing him to use the skill set that he would rather forget about i love a good action movie and this delivers i loved the character development and his relationships with the guy at work and the teenaged hooker loved it so much i may make it back to the movies again to see it will not discuss specific plot and story lines as that have been done repetitively here although the villain was great and kept my attention as well i loved the way he saunters around in his tailored suits and the mind bending exchanges that he and denzel have with one another,0.9831,1
"Overly unrealistic, just like ""John Wick"".",gilgongo1980,28 January 2020,6,as i said the story is too unrealistic for me a man against the entire russian mafia and he got away with only two small wounds this can only be a fantasy film the plot was actionpacked sometimes it was exciting but why do you need a simple man as superhuman i would like to see more reference to reality,0.6542,1
Equalizer,zenshemag,25 September 2014,10,superb movie however i could not understand the dialogue between the woman ciafbi secret service sitting on the porch with denzel visited from his past her dialogue was vaguely about giving him permission to resume his equalizer tasks just one more time or its okay to equalize since that portion of the promise was delivered to this deceased wife without wholeness anyway if someone could send me the dialogue between the two i would appreciate it very much i especially thought that the most critical scene occurred in the home depot location wherein robert ingeniously never used a gun to defeat his enemy additionally i applaud the security guard for his unselfish assistance in never leaving anyone behind even though he seemed to be mentally injured,0.7931,1
Brilliant,rhemie,21 July 2015,7,im honestly not much of a denzel washington fan still not however i havent enjoyed a film in a very long time as much as i did this one its got nothing to with denzel really well at least for me it doesnt but what truly made this film as outstanding as it was and utterly brilliant in every way possible was the way it was written the way the story unfolds the way it almost forces you to be neutral unless youre a denzel fan then youre obviously cheering him on from the moment the production studio logos appear but i cannot think of any other film help me if you know of any that so brilliantly makes two extremely opposite characters the protagonist and antagonist obviously or good guy and bad guy as we call them now appear so similar just to make them face off at the end in what usually is a sharp contrast of good versus evil and its really not a question of whos gonna win at the end because its obviously the good guy duh but the challenging part really is who do you root for we all love villains not that we root for them but we just love the characters but in this film you not only love the villain but you feel a strong urge to secretly root for him mainly because it takes a while for you to realise hes actually the bad guy so torn between two worlds youre literally forced to step out of the picture and eagerly watch the action unfold with bated breath to see what will happen next by the time the end credits roll youre still sitting motionless in your seat trying to take it all in the adrenaline in this film is extremely high even in some of the slower paced scenes watch with caution if you cannot handle that,0.9922,1
Brilliant action baddie gets what they deserve movie,howardhawker,24 March 2015,9,i was reminded of the edward woodward show and felt very diffident in case this was a take off well i need not have worried this is a well paced movie with a mysterious ordinary bloke played by the wonderful denzil washington who has extraordinary skills when it counts the film never pauses but is not runawayit maintains tension and whilst the denouement is never really in doubt ones arrival at it had me cheering wildly it was a miserable grey afternoon but this film made up for it in bucket loads highly recommended,0.9091,1
Too slow or Too less action?,mjhossin,12 March 2019,6,the beginning of this movie is too slow the story was not as i expected but it seems to me that this movie could have been finished early and i guess this is a action movie and mccall is a very strong and skillfull man as we can see in the movie but he kills the main villain of the movie without showing any skill as we see the villain called teddy is also a good skillfull fighter then at the end of the movie why there was no hand to hand fighting scene although i liked the last part where the lady came back and talk to mccall my opinion is that this movie could have been better,0.7343,1
appalling,StAdrian,22 October 2014,3,built entirely on clichés and relaying on questionable morality the movie is circular solving at the end the socalled problem that presented itself in the beginning the appalling evolution of the characters portrayed by the moral do what you feel like is surpassed only by their poor definition the script is trivial and contains elements never elucidated ie the role of starting and stopping when the character remembers the wrist watch when it comes to the camerawork i have to in all fairness say that its the best aspect of this movie i rated with however this is eclipsed by the editing and probably by the directors choice to film wide angles for example when he shouldnt have had,-0.2732,0
What do you see when you look at me?,ikizdevran-882-254684,4 August 2018,7,mark twain once said the two most important days in your life are the day you were born and the day you find out why the equalizer opens with this quote this quote reveals the purpose of the film and what to expect from it in the first minutes of the story we get an intense character depiction of robert bob mccall denzel washington this description is very important for the development and progression of the film robert is a perfectionist and overly organized he lives alone and works at a construction store he has insomnia and when he cant sleep he goes down to a diner where he drinks tea and reads in the beginning of the film he reads the old man and the sea from ernest hemingway if you know this book you can easily relate the old man to him his inner thoughts and dilemmas are similar to the old mans actually in the first minutes of the film director antoine fuqua tells you more or less everything you need to know about robert after this point nothing surprises you in the means of his life and actions during his visits to the diner he creates a special bond with a young russian hooker alina chloe grace moretz they mostly discuss about the book and its effects on the real life one night when alina is beaten up and sent to hospital he visits the russian mafia who are selling her and offer them to let her go they refuse the money and after a little talk he kills all the five men in the room brutally in seconds the film actually starts after this point this scene proofs that robert is not an ordinary man but a professional killer the equalizer is a one man show it is one man against the russian mafia this time an american hero saves a russian girl from the russians i normally hate this kind of stories where americans are the good guys and russians are the bad cold war is over and they keep making films like this however this one time i will pass on this fact because the story is much more complex than just the americans and russians also the main actor is one of my favorite actors of all time i know this approach is not professional but i am not a professional critic anyway as i said robert is a highly trained killer through the story we find out that he is a retired cia black ops operative he tries to live a quiet life but this kind of guys can never be left alone the more they try to stay away from trouble the more trouble finds them the equalizer is a story of a guy like that the story of the equalizer is like a chess game both sides are trying very hard to win they both think before they act and there is a constant attempt for anticipation of the opponents move this is the strongest point of the story the equalizer has the same idea as in john wick or taken series there is one man against everyone else the film is action packed and highly entertaining it is maybe a little brutal but this doesnt change the course of the film the soundtracks are equally beautiful the equalizer was loosely based on the tv series of the same name a couple of days ago the equalizer was released and tonight i am going to see it this was the main reason why i have seen the equalizer for the third time after tonight i am going to write also about the second film no matter how cheesy they can get i like stories like this people like robert are revengeful no matter how good and fair they are once you do something bad to them or to their loved ones they never hesitate to go until the end denzel washingtons performance is outstanding and it sets the limits for the film in films like the equalizer leading role performance is as important as the story itself because everything is based on this performance to be honest i dont recall a bad film from denzel washington i find a lot of similarities between him and morgan freeman washingtons performance is not the only outstanding performance in the film marton csokas as teddy rensennicolai itchenko puts an amazing performance as the villain of the film as well he plays a highly trained sociopath his performance makes an enormous difference when both the good and the bad guys performances are harmonized with a good story you get to see a film like the equalizer,0.9924,1
Same old but REALLY satisfying,MovieSonic,13 December 2014,8,i love denzel washington unfortunately i wasnt impressed with some of his latest films safe house was a joke and unstoppable was pretty horrific but nevertheless they are always entertaining i loved guns and i was really looking forward to this one the equalizer its definitely one of the better action films released in recent years some bad stuff i really dont think chloë grace moretz was suited for this role also her relationship with denzel was fake as hell a lot of the film all of it was highly manipulative denzel is everybodys saviour sad music at all the right moments and therere a lot of them waaay over the top slow motion usage etc the bad guy was super cheesy although i do like the actor in other films good stuff the action the kill scenes are epic and although denzel doesnt really pull off action scenes it doesnt matter because they are filmed superbly frankly this was more of a torturegore film than an action film once it got going overall this was typical hollywood crp but done really well and a must watch for actiongore fans,-0.2135,0
Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Denzel,statuskuo,20 December 2014,7,no one and i mean no one does revenge like denzel washington and when hes a man on fire you get giddy with expectation on his killing sprees especially if theyre cartoonish bad guys a video game come alive this movie is fun i grew up with the original tv seriesand the update is nice it is stripped of pure camp and gone the way of most denzel movies hes the best of the best with a dark past if you havent gotten enough of this watch this flick its a lot of the same but still worthwhile time waster antoine fuqua again proves he has a very sympathetic ear to the streets meaning he likes the percentage of people who are always getting screwed in life i like that i like that theme and i like there is someone who doesnt wear a cape or have superpowers that have been bestowed on them due to gamma rays or whatever its just a man who was upset nothing wrong in that if you spend too much time on the logic then screw youthis movie isnt your cup of tea go watch some british bbc spy movie that gives you every dull detail of its inception this is good ol fashion american buttwhipping fun,0.973,1

Hollywood Version of Mentoring,clacura,20 February 2018,8,take the action portion out from this movie and we see an older man who gains a sense of purpose defending and mentoring the young if just for this message this movie is worth viewing there is a dignity denzels character gives to life whatever his true inner purpose he is taking action to help those in need yes it is the hollywood version of a human with superhero skills i guess it is simply too much to make a movie of just a normal guy or gal who gives to others the subtext here is importantwe need mentors especially those who can defend the weak innocent and vulnerable it gives hope and restores dignity from those who rob it,0.9325,1
Allowing Instagram to Decide What I Watch While in Isolation Day 5:,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,28 March 2020,6,just one in a long line of old man gets revenge movies honestly the equalizer offers slightly more than most films in its oddly specific genre with a great lead performance from denzel washington and a competent director behind the camera training days antoine fuqua if you tend to like gritty dramas with bursts of graphic violence then this is truly better than most of the competition but if thats not your thing then you probably wont be won over by this,0.0266,1
A very good movie spoilt by a little too much violence,averyprivategentleman,12 July 2015,10,when i first wrote a piece about this movie i got panned by the readers for my opinions and the post was removedbeing a fan of the original tv series with ed woodward it was a bit of shock for me with the casting now excuse the pun but casting aside the casting i would like to have seen mccall played as the chap with the jaguar and the posh suits but this was not to be washington could have done a better job if production had given him the car and the outfitsbut hey maybe he gets promoted with a pay rise in the sequel one thing for sure i will never take the mickey out of someone working in bq again anyway back to the film great movie i have to admit they done a fantastic job here i bought the dvd and have watched it about times already the quotes are great if you feel bullied in life then this is film to eradicate all those doubts i could not deal with the violence there was too much of it teddy breaking the girls neck mccall drilling the gunmans head the corkscrew attack in the hit on slavi where all a bit ott for me but having said that this is a great vigilante movie i hope there is a sequel and the story continues washington does a fine job in playing mccall but to all the critics who panned me about casting in the last posting debacle how would it go if jude law was to be cast in a remake of in the heat of the night either way apart from a little over excessive violence this is a great message movie and the whole team done a great job well done,0.9894,1
Out of storyline,tlhalford,9 October 2014,7,i saw this on sunday at showcase cinemas i enjoyed parts of the film but to be honest a lot of the film could have been cut out robert has turned into a killer to try and get teri her freedom but she disappears for almost half of the film while she is gone robert kills the whole off teddys gang however teddy doesnt feel the need to kill robert and they can even sit across a dinner table from each other and talk like nothing has happened at first you think the bad guy is slavi as he is the man mentioned most by teri but thats the twist when he kills him very early on in the film we realise there is someone bigger than him denzel washington can be the perfect actor for any film but i dont think this film was his best compared to flight which i loved a walk among the tombstones was released around about the same time as the equalizer and there was no need to as they are pretty much the same they both have gory scenes with a lot of blood and they are both after person or gang all action films have the same predictable story its the actors that make the film great including martin csokas calm but deadly character and an innocent chloe grace moretz there are a few comical lines that made me laugh and the audience also found them amusing and there are parts that could make you feel faint my favourite part was the ending when robert finishes his mission in slow motion in a rainy warehouse with the soundtrack blaring in the credits eminem guts over fear ft sia i did prefer liam neesons a walk among tombstones as it was a more believable story to follow i would recommend this film to action film lovers but what i will say is not to expect anything too special overall i rate the film as i enjoyed the action packed parts but believe it went of the story line slightly,0.9911,1
"Semi-stylish, weak script, good acting.",jake-lamotta-batman,15 December 2014,5,the biggest issue with the equalizer has to be that it is an adaptation of an old tv show the script is full of the basic cliché which have been seen in numerous action films from the protagonist showing a character a picture and the facial expression gives it away that they know the character in a bad way of course or the let me tell you a story where the protagonist sits the antagonist down to tell him about someone the protagonist getting beaten down struggling in the final fight against the big henchman the reason why this film isnt ruined completely is the very well done performances by denzel washington and marton csokas antoine fuqua is a very poor mans david fincher at least in terms of this film this is one of his best film since training day but it is nothing special especially during a year like this which is filled with great films and performances its certainly tolerable as an action film with this film a lack of humour didnt hurt it too much whereas i found olympus has fallen suffered tremendously from its lack of humour i also find mr fuquas use of cgi a bit alarming in regards to how it looks ive noticed this in a few of his films where the cgi just looks bad and really sticks out the ending is immensely weak and although chloe grace moretz does a good job with what little shes given it really feels cheap the way they bring her in right at the end after being absent for so long showing denzel emailing her would have made more sense and wouldnt have looked as forced this shouldnt be a spoiler but if it is youll probably love this movie the finale occurs in the home hardware place where denzels character works now i didnt like the department store fight of mr mrs smith this one is a little bit better but not much i personally found it underwhelming as the first trailer i saw i figured you know what would be convenient for the screenwriters if they end up having a big shootout in the end inside that store these screenwriters obviously work in conveniences and fuqua would have a decent style if david fincher didnt exist id say this film is almost like fuqua mimicking fincher however all of david finchers films are comparatively better outside of alien,0.9506,1
A nice movie overshadowed by competition,destroyerwod,25 December 2014,7,honestly i had fun watching this there is probably plot holes and impossible stuff but who care its made to be an action type of movie yet that is the small problem i found in it its an action movie but the pacing is very slow there is a few action scenes here and there but way too few of them and sometimes even off screen on the other hand the story is nice denzel play his part very good chloe do the job even tough the role is small but maybe its because i saw john wick before i couldnt help myself but to compare the and its obvious when you do you realize one is an action fest on testosterone the other a nice movie but that do lack something the premise is not the same but similar the bad guys are both russian mobs in both case the protagonist is a guy with super skills and if i got to pick one yes john wick was much superior for me but that does not mean equalizer is not a good movie like i said i had a good time the movie is over hours long yet i was not bored despite it being slow paced the character is interesting the main bad guy acting and presence is nice although i had higher hopes for him and basically its what it is just a good action movie,0.9932,1
Antoine Fuqua and Denzel are a powerhouse,johnmorrisfamily,12 March 2024,9,this movie is brilliant the only reason i dont give it a is because that is reserved for the godfather and one flew over the cuckoos nest however in the action genre this is absolutely one of the best the cinematography is fantastic the lighting camera angles and film noir scenes give it a gritty realistic look the casting for the villains are terrific they are guys you really hate unredeemable men yet denzels character still gives them the chance to do the right thing denzel is a brilliant actor his look says it all without any dialogue i loved this movie and was on the edge of my seat until the very end should have one an academy award for best picture,0.949,1

"Super bloody, but still enjoyable",joshuadrake-39480,27 April 2015,7,the equalizer is a movie that i wanted to see because it was a movie that i wanted see because denzel washington was playing him and the director of training day antoine fuqua was directing it and the film was based on the s television series of the same name the film follows robert mccall and he is a retired black ops government operative who lives in boston massachusetts and works at a home mart hardware store where he befriends many of his coworkers and also tries to help a security guard trainee ralphie pass his qualification exam he has promised his deceased wife that he would leave his old life behind but is compelled to act after his teenage friend teri whose real name is alina was seen being mistreated by her pimp slavi and this leads into him seeking on the russian mafia he then identifies himself as the equalizer the film is a dream come true for me when this came out my mom got this movie for me on bootleg along with guardians of the galaxy while my sister daquantria got me captain america the winter soldier and i liked both of those but i also really like this film and it was so damn good the plot is really amazing and it does not take me that many times for me to understand and the script writer of this film richard wenk did a really great job and it was spectacular and amazing to see and hear the dialogue was really amazing and so damn spectacular the one major thing that bothers me and this is the reason why this movie appears on my top overrated movies list on imdb on my profile is because some of the action scenes can get a lot bloody and violent in a few areas i dont mind blood at all but its just that they use way too much blood in some of the action sequences in the equalizer the performances in this film as phenomenal in this film academy award winner denzel washington is known for his superbad villain role in the film training day which he won the oscar for best actor for his portrayal and that film is just beautiful and amazing and it is really cool to see him as a good guy fighting against the russians once again after what the russians did to him at the end of training day chloe grace moretz plays arina teri and she does a great job after i watched her in carrie and in dark shadows and she does two hell of a performances in those films and shes really nice here melissa leo despite my mixed feelings towards her in prisoners i like her in this film her performance is incredible bill pullman is in this film and does a really great job martin csokas plays teddy and he does a great job too despite the amount of screen time that he has in the film he does really great the production values are amazing especially the music and action sequences but like i said the action sequences are way too bloody gory and violent and i think it does not hurt my viewing experience this is an rrated film so if you did not like blood and violence dont watch it for all you sensitive kids but for all you people who likes blood and violence in action movies or scary movies or sciencefiction or zombie movies the equalizer is definitely worth a watch i give this movie a out of stars and the film is just really amazing and i have no problem watching this again and again the film is just really amazing and denzel washingtons performance is the best of his long time career and i encourage you to watch the film you might get something out of it,0.999,1
Fun Action Thriller; What the Punisher should have been,meltdownmonk,15 September 2016,8,i never thought of denzel washington as an action hero actor until watching this film the more i watched the more it felt like a superhero film and then by the end of it it felt like a slasher film with robert mccall denzel washington as the monsterserial killer the plot is the typical onesided hero wins every fight is essentially immortal type deal robert mccall is a good citizen day and night helping his coworker get a security job and befriending an escort and encouraging her to change her life into what she wants there was so much focus on the character and his habits and his relationships i couldnt help but fall in love with the movie i prefer sentimental movies with a lot of heart it may have been cheesy but i was sucked right in and yet also anticipating some serious destruction and violence i was almost scared to see it happen the fight scenes are brutal and quick but take moments to dwell on the method of death mccall has what i would call ocd or extreme attention to detail superpowers and precise timing of everything he does hes a complete nightmare for everyone he comes up against and yet also seems completely harmless so when he makes his offers to each and every criminal except the last one to stop what they are doing and change almost nobody listens to him and an action scene ensues despite the fact you know hes going to win every fight the movie still keeps you on edge the director likes to dwell on certain shots for extended periods of time the violence made me cringe and even look away more than once the exaggerated scenes result in a dark stylized moody and intense artsy and overindulgent kind of feel this is the movie that the punisher should have been in the punisher it was very difficult to care about the character in the equalizer it was hard not to and they do little to describe his past which adds to the mystique and mystery of mccall a monster a super hero a action star denzel was turned into something like a jack reacherjason bourneriddickbryan mills in this movie dangerous thoughtful smart maybe lacking in depth but plenty or pure action roller coaster ride thank you denzel washington and antoine fuqua for the entertainment,-0.6291,0
The Equalizer,joelsmith190,29 January 2015,7,ive got to say i want to see more of robert mccall the main protagonist of equalizer this guy is a realistic badass using his skill and perfect timing to even the odds in a onemanwar against the russian mob who have taken over his city at first i didnt buy this movie figuratively speaking first maybe minutes were a snore but once it got into its odd groove the movie is pretty cool some little bugs like an overuse of slowmotion in an attempt to make it cooler and some other stuff but the overall product isnt bad the musical score is awesome the only time i remember a better one is in transformers you can hate on the movie series but the musical score is one of the best ive heard the acting from washington is believable the overall believability in this movie help it gain its own footing in the individuality one of the things i wished they focused more on is his past its so murky that it leaves you scratching your head the movie is gritty dark and again realistic the preview was promising the style was cool but in the end most of the movie until the end is boring no immature boob shots so hurray,0.9929,1
"Beautiful, Done Right Movie",kenL-gonzo,17 August 2016,8,this was the best action ive seen in a long time let me explain the story is denzel is a retired man from an obviously highly trained organization trying to normally live his life and gets influenced by a sad prostitute that wants to sing so he goes on a rampage killing people to get her wish that may sound like a trope but no other movie does it better yes it wasnt the best movie ever but no movie gets everything right you think the clichés made it terrible well many movies would have a hard time making content to put in if they avoided all the clichés you think make movies worse i loved this simple good guy doing the right think movie and denzel is definitely better than arnold at this kinda movie,0.9538,1
What was the point again?,namikazedante,24 October 2017,4,this movie is lifted up by the presence of denzel chloe but when the action starts it just feel like something is missing and the slowmotion moments is used way too much it just feels like there is no point to this whole movie and i tried to get it why robert denzel washington did what he did but nope i was completely lost all the time and even at the end when the kingpin in russia asked the same question why and i first thought denzel would say uh i dont know i mean he didnt even know the little girl and didnt even trust her enough to tell her what happened to his wife etc nope it just felt like another brainless go in and kill everyone and i dont get it at the end all over sudden he couldnt take down one guy nope this movie was all over the place so yeah i was really disappointed,-0.7162,0

Denzel does what he does best...,Raydio,12 December 2014,8,i really enjoyed the equalizer denzel gives a fine performance as the coolasice professional who sorts out the bad guys and equalizes the equation its a role weve seen him do before in man on fire and he gives a seasoned performance again here the action was well paced and the story built nicely to a satisfying climax certainly the story was somewhat predictable with the final outcome all but inevitable but if you like films where good triumphs over evil and does so violently ala taken leon the professional then this film will not disappoint my only real criticism and this is really nitpicking was the song during the final credits ill say up front that im not an eminem fan but i found the lyrics distasteful and singingirritating just my opinion but it left an unfortunate final impression,-0.7475,0
Just a good movie... Nothing special.,metalheadvag,1 March 2015,6,an average movie with a common and cliché story a guy who was a cia agent has started a new quiet life but when he meets a young girl under the control of russian gangsters he has to help her the plot was really obvious there was nothing unpredictable that could surprise you denzel was good as usually and his character was quite likable and enjoyable violent scenes were good but i need more than that i am not saying that its bad but i didnt find anything special about this one there are so many movies exactly like the equalizer so as i said before it is just a good movie dont expect anything more my rate is,0.9054,1
[7.6] An Equalizer to this world,cjonesas,22 January 2024,8,would you imagine the equalizer without the super charismatic incontrol and deadly like a thorny curarelaced character yet soft as rose petals denzel washington i would not and i could not what is like an enhanced taken screenplay takes bigger and greater dimensions all because of him and the bright supporting cast being chloë grace moretz playing a sensible character as teri david harbour playing one of the big bad guys and the other very good supporting cast special recognition to johnny skourtis ralphie i loved the movie its theme its rocking score and most of all robert mccall an equalizer to this world screenplaystorylineplots development realism entertainment acting filmingphotographycinematography vfx musicscoresound depth logic flow actioncrimethriller ending,0.9734,1
A bit boring but those action scenes...,RevRonster,23 January 2015,6,i was hoping that having denzel washington and the director of training day onboard the equalizer would have been epic sadly its not but it still is a must watch in my opinion honestly i thought the story to this one was pretty messy and way too boring in way too many parts additionally the characters are pretty lackluster and dont really have much depth to themwell most of them anyway however the acting is great and denzel is just cold as ice in his role but the true shining light in this film is the brutal and gritty action sequences these parts break up the films tedium and monotony extremely well and singlehandedly make the film something to watch the equalizer might not have ended up as intriguing and engrossing as i had hoped it would have been but watching a cold calculating denzel deal out justice with an icy stare makes the film something to take in,0.9726,1

Stylish and surprisingly good action film,nicholls905-280-546911,9 May 2019,7,hollywood dont tend to make action films like this anymore and its an odd choice this film might have a basic core storyline with some government spook thrown in for good measure but it gets it right the film is grim and gritty but it is nice to see a revenge film dialled up it is not john wick tempo but it is never boring washington adds much needed weight in the lead,-0.5357,0

Denzel Washington. Need I say more? Okay I will:,gparnell-09096,18 January 2024,7,this is an obvious popcorn movie it has some real flaws some awful stinker decisions but hey its denzel and he can and will save the day and the movie overall i feel the acting was good by all involved even if the scripting and dialogue wasnt exceptional i didnt find the hardware store angle very mature and those portions of the films suffer accordingly but nothing against the acting it was simply a weak premise so i groaned and let it play out did i mention this movie has denzel washington this movie takes a different road than many in that the protagonists past was far more secretive it was not in your face about it which i found refreshing denzel played the role perfectly as a quiet calm deep and mysterious good guy with all sorts of skills lol the movie moves along very well i never got bored the bad guys were sufficient here there is everything a person could want in a movie like this but there are some problems it seems the director isnt much of a mans man and is painfully unaware of certain manly things these irked me some of the situations were outright ridiculous where about of any other man would act and react differently so there is some painful disconnect in some of the scenes in this regard but my bottom line i watched this twice almost years apart and enjoyed it both times at times this was a star movie and at times it was a star movie if you like this sort of thing hero guy with a secretive skill set past you should definitely watch you will not waste your time or money for me personally i simply cannot watch denzel washington and not love the role he plays he is one of the great actors and you just love whoever it is he plays in his films sorry for being biased no im not,0.9804,1
Don't expect too much excitement,Screen_Blitz,3 January 2015,5,to be honest denzel washington showed off a brilliant performance and his character is pretty good everything on the other hand was pretty mediocre the action scenes were a bit boring the plot was tiresome and there wasnt much excitement until the last twenty minutes chloegrace moretz did an okay job but she doesnt offer much screen time as i was hoping there were many scenes throughout that simply didnt make much sense which took away the films entertainment the action scenes were not terrible but i believe they could have been done much better the main character denzel washington fights off some of the russian gangsters near the beginning and the fight looked rather unrealistic especially when he drives that corkscrew through the guys jaw the final fight scene at the end however was pretty good and was a good end to the climax i recommend this film to anyone who is a denzel washington fan,0.9851,1
"Two big flaws, but everything else is amazing.",maxgraffu,16 January 2022,7,first of all i must say that i was quite disappointed with marton csokas playing the main antagonist he is an amazing actor but something about him displaying a russian psychopath didnt feel authentic they should have casted an actual russian in my opinion also at some points the plot lacked of plausibility i often asked myself why is this happening right now wouldnt something else make much more sense though these two downsides were quite annoying they are the only ones the way the dialogues are written is really clever especially the way robert the main character is answering tricky questions is super cool in contrast to csokas washington is perfectly casted for his role as well as chloe moretz who i would have wished to see more of in the movie the way action is directed is super satisfying and even the most brutal moments have their own odd way looking aesthetic,0.9536,1
Ideal Denzel,christyshopped,14 April 2024,9,his heart is pure hes beautiful hes skilled i had such a good time and amwait for the next one im a denzel worshipper and therefore biased but i enjoyed this so much more than john wick the wick films may be better executed but i was left cold by the wick character so much so that ive put off watching the next denzel is riveting as always i thought all of the performances were great but he effortlessly carries the whole picture the only criticism i would have is that the exposition was sometimes a little heavy handed and we didnt need to see his observation technique the same way each time it would have been enough to see it once and then just let denzels face tell us thereafter,0.9354,1
Entertaining but nothing more,atrevino90,6 October 2014,6,its just another entertaining action movie no complicated plot and sometimes it doesnt even make sense but it will if you just shut your mind fairly predictable some scenes are interesting while other ones are completely ridiculous like when denzels character tortures a guy by putting him on a car and filling it with smoke a guy who would never break apparently the only thing he doesnt break is the window of the car or at least put your arm before it closes its certainly not gonna chop your arm off anyway denzel is the usual bad ass he plays on most of his movies you know that always calm guy that makes unusual things making you think hes insane and capable of anything which for me is kind of getting old the only way to enjoy this movie is to set your mind back as if youre twelve years old and never have watched a denzel washington movie,0.954,1
"A thrilling, entertaining action thriller that's comparable or better than Taken",YJLcool,28 September 2014,9,brick by brick dollar by dollar body by body i promised i wouldnt go back to being that personbut for you im going to make an exception this is what denzel being an absolute badass says that to his enemy in a key scene of the film just when you think liam neeson was great as a lonewolf action hero in taken here comes denzel washington upping the ante as mccall the equalizer yeah i was completely sold by his performance based on the tv series of the same name denzel stars as mccall a retired man with a shady past armed with a formidable set of skills like no other chose to work at a home depot hardware store and lives a quiet peaceful life however he soon discovers all the injustice that are happening around the neighbourhood and decides to take matters into his own hands to equalize the situation by helping the helpless first and foremost i couldnt provide any comparisons with the old tv series as ive never watched any of the episodes before similar to taken or man on fire i dont deny the fact that the film has a preposterous premise one guy against the entire mob seriously however despite its silliness denzel washington a twotime academy award winner with numerous badass roles in the past such as man on fire the taking of pelham the book of eli and unstoppable managed to deliver a strong convincing performance with some very catchy powerful punchlines that actually makes the viewers believe that hes the guy who is really capable of taking down the entire russian mafia on his own he owns the character and makes the character come to life on screen aside from that we get to know him just from his expressions when his personal background is briefly mentioned in the film although the film relies on a few plot contrivances for it to work typical issue for most action thrillers and it also includes the much overused walkaway explosion scene again but denzel just look so badass whenever he fights on screen that i willing to overlook some of its flaws on the other hand marton csokas did a great job in his portrayal of teddynikolai the intimidating and menacing russian mob fixer whos sent by the mob to deal with the situation theres one particular disturbing scene in which he slowly circles a terrorstricken prostitute while comforting and reassuring her that its going to be okay before leading her to an inevitable fate chloë grace moretz did a fine job as teri as well its such a shame that she was taken off screen rather early in the film only to reappear again in the final moments the film gives a satisfying climax and the action is well choreographed another notable mention is that the film contains a lot of bloody and gory violence if some viewers feel uncomfortable with onscreen gruesome violent fights then in that case its probably not advisable to watch this film however please keep in mind that these people the mafia characters the actors portrayed are not considered as humans but merciless scumbags they treat women as nothing other than sexual objects for money willing to kill anyone without hesitation or remorse thinking theyre high and mighty and forcibly exert authority and influence over others in the film mccall gave them a choice beforehand but they choose to belittle him instead so violence was necessary and theyve got exactly what they deserve to be honest i dont feel sorry for them at all overall the film exceeds all my expectations the film delivers in spades i expect denzel washington to kick some criminal ass and ive gotten more than i bargained for gruesome and brutal but highly rewarding revenge is a dish best served cold highly recommended rating one day someone does something unspeakable to someone you hardly knew so you do something about it because no one else is going tobecause you can,-0.8716,0
"Solid enough thriller, but it's far too long and never seems entirely sure what it wants to be",jimbo-53-186511,30 May 2015,6,denzel washington plays robert mccall a man with a mysterious past who is now working at a diy centre mccall now enjoys the quiet life but when he meets teri chloe grace moretz a young girl who is brutalised whilst shes under the control of the russian mob mccall finds that he needs to use all his specialist skills and knowhow to bring the mob down and set teri free from them the first notable problem with this film is its running time and clocking in at around the hour minute mark one could argue that theres not enough material to justify such a long running time it also seemed that the writers didnt really know what sort of film that theyre making it starts off with mccall having to protect teri from the mob then while shes laid up in hospital it then turns into a death wish type film where mccall becomes a vigilante and makes his mission to avenge anyone who wrongs his work colleagues then hed go back to pursuing the mob and then it would cut back to mccall protecting his work colleagues these deviations were good to watch but had nothing to do with the story making me wonder why they were included it does make the film a little messy at times and a lot of it felt like unnecessary filler mccall is an antihero here and is a fairly likable individual hes a bit of a man of mystery and we learn very little about him throughout the film i do get a bit annoyed when films dont develop their characters but this wouldnt matter so much if this film had a much tighter running time to minutes but its tough to get fully involved in a film thats this long when your main character hasnt been developed at all aside from not learning much about mccalls past the writers dont bother to explain other things such as mccall constantly stopping and starting his watch did he suffer from some kind of timeobsessed compulsive disorder how did he manage to track down the bloke that robbed the money from the store and the ring from the woman hes clearly got an eye for detail as he noticed various distinguishing features on the man but how did he track him down after he left although i had quite a few issues with this film i have to admit that i did enjoy it and its great fun watching denzel kick a load of ass and at nearly years old hes quite clearly not too old for this sht just yet the editing is also fast sharp and of very high quality the final showdown at the end was also entertaining and it was quite intriguing seeing how mccall would off each baddie denzel washington is great here and does pretty much everything that jason statham can do only with washington you get better acting and perhaps slightly more charisma moretz is a good little actress but shes criminally underused here the equalizer is a fairly good film but it felt like the writers tried to do too much and as a result it made the film far longer than it needed to be still the fight sequences are good the showdown at the end was fun and creative and despite the odd lull now and again i never got to the point where i was bored its certainly worth a look and the ending also suggests that there may be a sequel,0.9948,1
One of the best movies this year!,correia-c,17 December 2014,8,i was really surprised by this movie its really entertaining the movie communicate really well with the audience great picture this is how heroes come to life this is a good starting point for more movies equalizers i mean i was seeing movies all year and to someone like me that sees almost every movie out there its not easy to get glued to the screen the story is not new but it was a pleasure to see it nice i really dont see how can others say this is not a good movie maybe its not a new thing but its very well made i read that this movie is not good because the age os the main star common really what else but not a experienced trained operative i can say that if you see it you will not regret the time i didnt,0.9857,1
Denzel Washington good but overall forgettable,calorne,2 August 2022,6,i started watching the sequel as it was free with my streamer but then decided to check if i had seen the first one i watched the trailer and it all looked new and so paid a couple of quid to watch the films in sequence denzel washington does a very good job as a cool calm and collected rough justice provider but about half way into the film i realised from one scene that i had seen the movie before aside from that scene which although fairly innocuous i recalled i remembered nothing else although was able to predict the ending but this tells me that the film is run of the mill rather than stand out and just blends into the blur of multiple films with a similar theme,0.9512,1

Won't be looking at the home depot the same after this movie,amandria1,28 September 2014,9,every bit as tough as john mcclane in a die hard movie no sarcastic quips though cool calculating swift and smart is the way i would describe this character deep inside many of us wish for justice that someone would protect us if we needed it that someone would stand up and do the right thing the dangerous thing the reason we love super heros so much we want the world to be more just we want the world to be more fair for their to be those with nerves of steel unabashedly facing the ills of the world this is why this movie works we want more people like this in the world someone who is a one man wrecking machine but against the bad guys we want to ourselves be this brave to be this lethal to be this smart to be this brave we want the bad guys to have their asss handed to them this character is stoic and kind solitary and lonely scarred but true he cares about others and puts his caring into action he even gives the bad guys an out and when they dont take it it takes them out,0.98,1
A dark nasty little action thriller that we don't get to see much of anymore,Robert_duder,6 October 2014,8,the best thing for me about the equalizer was that it felt in some ways like an oldschool ss adult action thriller its one of those dark gritty twisted films that bucks genre elements and says im gonna be violent and dark and if you dont like it dont watch it the equalizer is brutally violent im shocked they got this released without being severely watered down it could be called an actionthrillerdramahorror hybrid and there are few films like that add in the fact that you have the extremely strong charisma of denzel washington and a complex and captivating character and you have one hell of a good time at the movies its death wish meets batman meets jason bourne and how can you go wrong with that sort of mix the film opens at a slower pace carefully introducing our main character and giving him significant depth that you wouldnt normally get in your typical action film by the time this movie is done you will be left breathless but youll be asking yourself questions about our antihero robert mccall for hours later who is he what is his training where did he come from what does all the subtle hints at his past add up to the creation of this character is absolutely brilliant and if they serialize thisthey could unravel him as they go i have always liked denzel washington he is a brilliant actor with an amazing career however i have also said before that he often exudes a certain egotism in his performances that is toned down in this part but it is there a little bit but its also necessary he is a man with insane unstoppable killing abilities trying to control them and dealing with a lot of his own dark demons the character has significant ocd and it only serves to add to a host of questions is his condition in order to control his killing does it have to do with training is it ptsd washington is this character and he is perfect in it the brilliant young actress whom i adore chloë grace moretz is good in a unfortunately small role as a wayward girl who robert mccall takes a protective role with when she is hurt and nearly killed it inspires him to get back into action righting wrongs and crossing off thugs moretz is very good and this is a very adult role for her but it works her innocence and down to earth charisma makes you feel a lot of empathy for her character we have a number of villains or big bads in the film each of varying degrees of mobster david harbour is very good as a crooked cop and a formidable foe to washington for awhile at least david meunier is sold but short lived as a scumbag pimp but marton csokas absolutely steals the show as thee main villain he is a cold blood psychotic killer with skills not unlike washingtons and he is the sort of action hero villain you simply dont see anymore in films he is terrific his final scene opposite washington might go down as one of my favourite in action films johnny skourtis is also really great as mccalls good friend and sort of partner think equalizers reginald veljohnson of die hardmake sense he adds some humanity and down to earth qualities to washingtons character despite top billing bill pullman and melissa leo are barely there as cameos midway through the film as expected antoine fuqua holds no punches there are some downright nasty blood splattering death scenes that had me cringing and really forcing myself to stare at the screen and not cover my eyes he directs the action scenes to near perfection because while we get two or three full on violent hand to hand battles many of the fight scenes are implied we know mccall can kill we know how he does it and we can imagine him doing it so we come in after hes already done it or jump over it as hes walking away this way we dont get tired of seeing him in action and are inundated with his insane skills this is a rare film because our hero is literally very nearly unstoppable he is a killing machine and hardly gets a scratch on him by the end of the film you figure he must be very close to the most deadly man alive and he has this deep emotional attachment to the human race that he wants to protect the innocent when i first heard of this film my initial thought was that it wouldnt be the same as the tv serieswhich it isnt at all because it would be one single case he was dealing with fuqua cleverly handles this by giving him more than one instance where he helps the innocent he handles like a good superhero origin story the film is straight up excellent i will watch it again i was completely entertained it is far from mainstream junk and it is one of the most entertaining movies i have seen in a very long time i feel as though the quality of future instalments would not be nearly as good which may deter washington from doing them at all but i will be there if they do because i want to know more,0.9921,1

Hoping for better from Denzel,jrwt54,29 September 2014,5,i am a great fan of denzel washington and really wish he made more movies but this one i didnt enjoy yes his performance was good he always is but the movie was nothing but one scene of stylized violence after another i enjoy bad guys getting there due as much as anyone but sometimes its just a little too much and frankly just ridiculous here you have two intelligent people couldnt they find something more interesting to do with nikolai and robert but this again hollywood suffers from really terrible storytelling it seems the only good storytellers are disney and dreamworks maybe denzel should consider doing an animated movie or some indie movies instead of this junk we know that theyre going to do this story again i hope that somewhere there is a good writer that they can tap,-0.6782,0

"Almost as good as Goodfellas, La Femme Nikita, or the Usual Suspects",starspiredevelopment,19 April 2015,8,i love denzel washingtons work again in this film his work is satisfying this story though common was interesting and the makeup was excellent some of the shots were too soft for the hardened criminals that were to be depicted however i particularly dont agree with shooting older men from below seeing a witty denzel is more interesting than seeing a puffy denzel everyone looks puffy being shot from below unless they are rail thin andor under the age of it would have been ok to just shoot the young people from below and the older people at eye level or above to make it more dramatic the one scene that i did not like was the tanker being blown up as it was the same scene from the usual suspects the same everything slow mo walking blowing up in the background someone young probably directed this and didnt see that movie or they quoted it in any case it was still a very interesting good film that is worth watching my favorite part was that denzel won again i like that about him,0.9576,1
Entertaining,akshatmahajan,2 November 2023,8,i never had a chance to watch this movie but when i today i finally watched it its pure entertaining action drama which gives you john wick type vibes im not comparing the movies both are good in their own style the story was simple and effective the screenplay was good but little bit loose the direction was good and the performances were aldo good especially denzels the climax fighting sequence could have been shortened as it felt a little bit stretched to me and giving the final villian such a short time and killing him so instantly was the shortcoming overall i enjoyed the movie and you should definitely give this movie a try,0.9727,1
Grisly patchwork of tired themes,elmerflp,8 November 2014,3,this film is not for the faint of heart due to an unbelievable amount of ultraviolence for example kubricks clockwork orange seems like a disney movie by comparison sometimes creativity can be a bad thing when it documents in graphic detail all sorts of choking pummeling corkscrewthroatimpaling shooting nailgun killing and the like underlying all this creative carnage and dismemberment are many of the tired old themes we have seen before such as the peaceful and contemplative man whipped up into an orgy of bloodletting denzel washingtons character the hooker with a heart of gold chloe grace moretzs character and the psychotic russian mobster marton csokass character this is not i repeat not a good date movie consider yourself warned,0.4433,1
"Much More Enjoyable than I Expected,",lesleyharris30,21 March 2015,8,the equalizer is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast it ended up a lot better than i expected ill watch anything with denzel washington but this appeared very cliché and typical from its trailers offering nothing interesting or new material for moviegoers while it may not have the most original set up and storyline it makes up for it with a dazzling performance from washington and antoine fuquas cool and slick directing style this saves it from being a boring movie its a very good franchise vehicle for washington he owns this role his character has many flaws which manage to make the character more likable and help us symphatize with him more but there is still a lot to learn about robert mccall which future sequels could answer it has its flaws but the equalizer mostly makes up for it by being a generally enjoyable movie and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or thriller a man who decides to put his dark past behind him must jump back in to action to save a young girl who is under the control of russian gangsters best performance denzel washington worst performance bill pullman,0.9854,1
One of Denzel Washington's best action movies,mrdanielkanewilliams,31 January 2024,8,in the film denzel washington plays a retired spy called robert mccall who now works in a hardware store and in his spare time he helps various people theain person he helps in this film is his friend elena who has been forced into a world of prostitution and one of her clients beats her up after seeing elena at the hospital robert goes on a revenge spree and starts taking down the whole gang of drug dealers and pimps that elena has got involved with whilst robert is taking down these bad guys there are plenty of fighting scenes where he kills the drug dealers in a stylish but some of these scenes are over a bit too fast there is also one scene where one of the cashiers in his store is robbed and instead of showing a fight scene it just show him buying the hammer and then cleaning it the morning after the last fight scene is by far the best part because robert fights against the last few bad guys and kills them in gory ways also during this scene some of the bad guys are hard to kill and you feel like robert has met his match,-0.9817,0

Overrated,sure_man,26 October 2014,4,visually appealing yet remarkably devoid of content and vitality but thats what a hollywood action potboiler is supposed to be all about isnt it im not sure what i was expecting and yes ill have to reflect on that but ridiculously slicinganddicing and hole punching and barbwire garroting etc the generic russian prison tattooed bad guys in the local hardware warehouse left me cold and annoyed id shelled out the price of a ticket i wonder how it would have played if hed worked at dunkin donuts admittedly the bad guy was venal and repulsive just another thug doing his job trained on the streets of grozny when no one else on the oligarchs staff can get the job done and he got his just desserts yay and the reformed teenager finding him on the street at the end to thank him youre kidding right,-0.928,0
"""I don't have a lot of time. Which means you don't have any.""",gettodamoofies,5 September 2023,8,film who needs batman when youve got a senior citizen who works at the local hardware store no one apparently if the equalizer has anything to say about it denzel washington steps into the role of robert mccall a calm and collected employee at a hardware store by day and a righteous vigilante by night its a premise that might remind you of certain other action heroes cough john wick cough but its worth noting that mccall was doling out justice a month before mr wick even stepped onto the scene washington and director antoine fuqua do an outstanding job in developing mccalls character its a calculated development making sure that even though hes out for vengeance youre rooting for him all the time hes such a nice guy when he isnt taking out bad guys and washingtons performance gives mccall a depth thats truly engaging sure its not exactly a novel story the lone hero seeking revenge against the russian bad guys but damn is it entertaining the action sequences are intense and mccalls methodical approach to taking down his adversaries is both satisfying and mesmerizing to watch the pacing keeps you engaged and the supporting cast including chloë grace moretz as teri adds to the overall appeal the chemistry between mccall and teri brings an emotional layer to the film that elevates it beyond your typical action flick overall the equalizer might not reinvent the wheel when it comes to its plot but it doesnt need to with denzel washington in the drivers seat and antoine fuqua at the helm its a thrilling ride from start to finish if youre looking for a wellexecuted action movie with a character you can genuinely invest in give this one a shot format bluray video presentation detail level excellent colour reproduction excellent level accuracy excellent encode excellent master condition excellent audio dtshd ma audio dialogue reproduction excellent soundtrack effects clarity excellent dynamics excellent surround sound presentation excellent lfe content excellent moofiemeter,0.999,1
The Equalizer for sure has it's own problem but it's just doesn't change the fact that it's just fun and entertaining all the time,FallsDownz,1 November 2014,8,in my country thailand its pretty bad luck for the equalizer to hit the cinema when john wick a very success action movie staring keanu reeves just came out last week because of that its just make everyone compare the equalizer to john wick instantly and thats pretty unfortunate for the equalizer the problem that the equalizer has but john wick does not is john wick is a action movie that know it self really well it doesnt try to be anything else other than an fully action kickingass movie but the equalizer just trying and push the script and its dramatic too hard despite the script is not actually that good or even that much interesting and with the slow style of storytelling by antoine fuqua the director of this movie its just make it even worst because not only the plot is not interesting and you dont really care it that much the movie just force you to eat it anyway and very slowly too and thats make the first half of this movie fells boring but when the first half is actually over and denzel washington goes to kicking someone the movie just come back to the right track instantly the action scene is pretty good and really entertaining but its more like a close combat rather than shoot everything in john wick but i personally like the action scene in the equalizer more denzel washington himself again really badass in this movie with his cold brutal meaning style of acting makes this movie really fun to watch theres also chloe grace moretz in this movie shes pretty good in it but unfortunately the role she got just really not good enough so shes not that memorable as she should be but despite characters she doing pretty good in this movie overall the equalizer is still a really fun badass action movie staring denzel washington it has its own problem for sure and a huge problem too but that doesnt change the fact that the movie is fun and entertaining to watch a lot,0.9228,1
The Only Cure for an Infested PlanetThe Fictional Vigalante,LeonLouisRicci,31 January 2015,8,as long as corruption and the savage exploitation of the weak and virtually helpless people are extorted and preyed upon there will exist at least in fiction the vigilante the character comes in various forms of gender and skill set but make no mistake villains beware its a job that needs to be done and in the real world no one seems willing or able to do it so in this reel world there is the equalizer hollywood has often been called the dream machine and thats about all the folks can do is dream on so let the dreaming begin its a year old denzel washington sporting his aging well as the titular hero antoine fuqua is the director and the character is brought back to life from the tv series the films style is not ramped up as some of these tend to be but is a slow cooker even when it is dispensing with a multitude of macholooking bad men with more tattoos than brains the movie is not as good as the genre gets but it is passable in a dream time kind of way and the catharsis is present and thats what the doctor ordered for it seems like that is the only cure for a disease infesting the planet the evil that men do long live the fictional vigilante,-0.9546,0

FFS Denzel!! Why?,johnmassam,8 October 2014,2,not a remake of the great series starring the imperious edward woodward with that out of the way i will begin denzel plays a man living a fruitless existence trapped in his thoughts of a shadowy and chequered past so far so good as denzel appears to have slipped back into the acting mode which has been sadly missing for so many years a brooding and thoughtful performance some might say im really beginning to enjoy myself at this stage bang i really cannot begin to explain my disappointment as denzel suddenly descends into killing mode how many ways can a human being kill another human being lots typical formulaic hollywood crap ensues none of the action is even remotely original a total bore fest for the remaining mins leaves me clambering for the exit as the end credits being to roll all in all this has been done before and to far greater effect in taken at least taken doesnt pretend to be something it isnt,-0.2972,0
"A well performed solid action drama, better than reviews have suggested.",azanti0029,29 December 2014,8,robert mccall washington works at home depot during the day where he encourages his fellow colleagues to achieve and be more at night he sits and reads in a hour dinner and does the same to a local escort who eats there after a slow burning start its not long before this widower turns into a one man army taking down the russian mob and corrupt policeman alike se entirely among the working class population of boston its set among an urban america not populated by any middle class characters and is all the better for it based on all original television series starring the late edward woodward which always felt a bit cheesy here director fuqua takes a more gritty and real approach mccall at the start is just a nobody but pretty soon its obvious he is a man with a past which is never entirely revealed to us the russian mob led by the dark and scary teddy an excellent martin csokas are determined to stop him you know from the beginning that the film will end with a climax involving the aisles and lots of power tools but thats okay the film is well paced well directed and has an edginess thats just on the right side of believable and well away from the wrong side of the likes of taken all the cast do well and theres a very small cameo from bill pullman at one stage where more is hinted at about mccalls past but this is washingtons film all the way giving a brooding performance as he dispatches bad guys between breakfast and dinner while taking the moral high ground its a good modern imagining of the original series nothing more nothing less an undemanding well made thriller that will past the time quite pleasantly,0.9867,1
ye,arnold_kamche,10 December 2014,9,the equalizer movie review starring bill pullman chloë grace moretz chloe moretz david harbour denzel washington haley bennett marton csokas melissa leo first of all i am one of denzel washingtons biggest fan as i have till date been able to watch all his movies the latest and most recent movie is called the equalizer i have just watched it minutes ago and i couldnt help but post a review about this an action thriller stocked with weighty dramas gangs and denzel washinton heroically taking the law into his hands to bring justice to the weaker party mccall denzel washington is an ex brave commando who faked his death to live a quiet life in boston his new life style is mainly comprised of days working at a local hardware super store while trying to ease restless nights by reading and keeping informal company with other night hawks at a local diner his lone quiet life gets interrupted causing him to come out of his selfimposed retirement to rescue a young girl teri chloë grace moretz in the process of saving her he finds himself face to face with ultraviolent russian gangsters as he serves vengeance against those who brutalize the helpless mccalls desire for justice is reawakened if someone has a problem the odds are stacked against them and they have nowhere else to turn mccall will help he is the equalizer denzel washington makes up a lot of ground lost on the page with a subtle and layered dramatic performance even though a lot of mccalls motivations and bookstore are poorly explained washingtons portrayal tells enough of a story all its own in order to make robert engaging often conveying a lot of his history and pains through a guarded haunted stare so even though the writer doesnt nail down the character the leading man makes up for it by filling in the details through show rather than tell by the end washington has completed enough of an arc to make robert both ratable badass and still intriguing enough to further explore in future chapters the rest of the cast revolves around washington but manage to each hold their own against him on screen chloë grace moretz is just as good as denzel at showing her characters story and personality through subtle performance and mannerisms teri is at once a hardened street warrior and a vulnerable child and moretz carries that balance in a way that feels real but never like the typical weak victim or damsel in distress teri and roberts bond is interesting to watch and provides fertile ground for the films violent narrative to unfold basically the equalizer is an averagejoe bluecollar version of a comicbook avenger secretly stalking those responsible for abusing and preying upon innocent citizens and this film acts as an origin story with an ending that suggests a new franchise is afoot it might not be bad for washington to stay in the action game in a series that at least acknowledges those who qualify for a senior discount can be crusaders too this movie is mainly based for adults for those who have undergone bullying for those who have lost trust and faith in human beings this movie is for those who are doing good in the world it is to show us it is right to defend the weaker ones i will strongly not recommend this movie to teens aged below as there is some strong violent bloody actions and languages so i believe teens under that aged are most probably easier to get influenced as they might misunderstand the message portrayed by the movie the movie is mpaa rated as r my personal opinion about the movie putting aside that i am the greatest fan of denzel washington is out i was entertained and i will watch three to four times more my name is arnold kach i am years old and i am studying major in international business at guangdong university of foreign studies guangzhouchina i work part time to meet ends and be responsible i love to play football basketball swimming and mostly i exercise at the gym everyday i am a big fan of movies i always make sure i was one movie before bed i hope my brief review was useful and i greatly recommend you to go watch it if you skip it you have definitely missed the year,0.9865,1
Most Entertaining,bob-rutzel-1,31 December 2014,9,retired cia agent robert mccall denzel washington tries to lead a quiet life but a neardeath beating of escortprostitute alina chloe grace moretz by the russians changes that quiet life this movie is based upon the equalizer tv show in the mid starring edward woodward a good show btw in the beginning of this movie we are shown a statement by mark twain that says there are two important days in a mans life the day he is born and the day he finds out why this applies to robert mccall as you will see and yes it applies to all of us too that is probably the most provocative thing mark twain has ever said mccall is the calm before the storm and then he becomes the storm as you will see okay a quiet controlled storm the movie starts off slowly to set things up for mccall to help alina mccall tries to buy alinas freedom from the russians and you know that wont work there is only one thing left to do and he does it problems continue when the big boss pushkin vladimir kulich in russia sends his top enforcer teddy marton csokas to find and kill mccall you will note that mccall calls teddy nicholi csokas does a very good job of being mccalls antagonist and i am sure we will see more of him the acting all around is excellent the fighting scenes are brutal and intense you will see blood the music is heartracing all the way through and pretty good too a downside i found was the big fight scene within the place mccall works home mart like home depot too many scenes in the dark still good but in the dark you said that already move over jason bourne bond james bond and the liam neeson character with the skills to right all wrongs we have another player a vigilante if you will who has decided he knows why he was born at the end mccall becomes the equalizer as we see him offering to help someone as he replies on his laptop did i hear someone say sequel this is most entertaining and we like the quiet controlled storm denzel washington brings to robert mccall the equalizer violence yes sex no nudity no language yes,0.9847,1
Amazing in its prescience of Russian meddling,safenoe,10 October 2017,9,odds against you need help indeed the hillary clinton campaign could have called upon the equalizer to battle against the russian led fake news in the presidential campaign just in case youre wondering miriam webster defines prescience as foreknowledge of events and it seemed this blockbuster really seemed to have its finger on the pulse when it came to the russian gangsters who are infecting the american social fabric im a huge fan of the equalizer tv series and this movie carries on the fine tradition thats for sure no messing around by mccall he gets the job done delivers justice and rails against police corruption perhaps in the sequel he can also rail against the tsa agents who like to pick on minorities and maybe mccall deliver his own kind of justice to them melissa leo and bill pullman play former cia operatives and its good to know melissas character can beat rush hour traffic by getting a lift home in a helicopter it beats having to encounter the tsa brutes at the airport,0.9671,1
Violent... and monotonous!,kshirad,27 September 2014,4,dont get me wrong i love denzel washington i love every action flick he plays in cause he brought such charisma on the big screen this one is an exception i was ready to get pumped up by all the gore galore and crazy fight choreographs and its not what i am expecting at all the story is about a man named bob mccall a mysterious man i might add who stumbles upon the world of russian gangster he met a girl named teri who is one of their prostitute that one day got beaten bob got furious and goes for vengeance against them the movie got me all right but ive never been so bored in my life lets start from the action it didnt work it supposed to give me any impact yet i felt nothing blood are spurting everywhere all right but why do they have to make it so bland the actors done all their things the script requires nothing evoked emotions from me i blame the screenwriters for giving no depth and not a single twist bad move although there are several things im going to highlight like the camerawork i loved antoine fuquas style and it gives the movie more dignity than it was and some scene involving chlöe grace moretz with denzel gave me a little bit interest for the dynamic they showed i know denzel washington fans are going to love it but just a fair warning its not really fun to watch even if the violence pushes your button in the end its a bit of a dud,0.9676,1
There's A New Face To Justice: The Equalizer.,Vivekmaru45,29 December 2014,10,denzel washington has been a favorite of mine since my teens with hit movies like philadephia the pelican brief fallen john q virtuosity crimson tide man on fire the hurricane deja vu training day american gangster the book of eli inside man the bone collector malcolm x mississippi masala heart condition and ricochet he has won a place in the hearts of all cinema lovers this film is an intense action thriller about a man who is trying to protect the ones he loves and fighting against evil in whatever form it may be be it pimps drugdealers corrupt cops the equalizer has an answer to all in this film denzel plays the role of robert mccall a retired black ops government operative who lives in boston massachusetts and works at a home mart hardware store where he befriends many of his coworkers and also tries to help a security guard trainee named ralphie pass his qualification exam mccall has promised his recently deceased wife that hed leave his old life behind but is compelled to act after his teenage friend teri chloë grace moretz whose real name is alina was seen being mistreated by her pimp alinas life was destroyed at the age of five or six when she was a victim of sex trafficking by the russian mafia and then became their sex slave and forced into prostitution robert vows to save her after she is hospitalized after being brutally beaten by her pimp slavi david meunier mccall enters a restaurant owned by the russian mob and tries to convince slavi to release alina by paying him but slavi refuses find out what happens next the film is directed by veteran director antoine fuqua who has directed acclaimed films like training day as well as the replacement killers tears of the sun king arthur shooter brooklyns finest olympus has fallen the good thing about him is that with each film he keeps getting better and he adapts to the style of film denzel washington gives a very powerful performance as a man who is pushed to the limits and has no other option but to retaliate with extreme force opposite him is equally good actor marton paul csokas who has starred in films like xxx evilenkoa must see film æon flux and kingdom of heaven marton plays as an enforcer to the russian crimelord vladimir pushkin the film has intense action scenes filled with graphic violence and so it is only suitable for persons over years the background music cinematography and script is topnotch and well polished to my belief i did not see any plotholes in the film it is a solid action thriller which will become a cultclassic as one of the later films in denzel washingtons career,0.9637,1
Not All Movies Are Created Equal,moviescoundrel,26 September 2014,8,i have to say that after skimming a couple of reviews before seeing this i was skeptical it would be very good the last actionsuspense movie similar to this that i recall denzel being in was safe house with ryan reynolds that had some potential i thought but was very mediocre i was not exactly sure how this plot was going to unfold we are introduced to roberts washington character and see that he has a very particular solo obsessive compulsive type of life and habits he does have a couple of relationships with people who he cares about and is trying to help better their lives when a friends life is in danger robert has to become the man he used to be once again in order to help keep her safe unfortunately by doing this robert also awakens a bit of a beast with a lot more problems than he expected i had first thought that most of the plot would be based on this antagonistprotagonist idea and robert versus this russian mafia this is the central plot but there are also some pretty cool side plots where we see robert help others that are being wronged all after putting in an honest days work at home mart which is a big box store similar to home depot a couple of the things i read about this movie said it was too violent it is violent robert executes with extreme precision and uses any instrument that his hands come into contact with i find this pretty entertaining and while violent the point is made and most of the men that are on the receiving end of this type of punishment not only are very bad men but also have a chance to make things right or change before they receive their punishment the cinematography the sound the action and the subtle acting of washington make this one very good although i lowered my expectations a bet this one was pleasantly surprising and is probably worth a second viewing for sure,0.8191,1
hell yeah !,solangebogolina,12 October 2014,9,denzel washington is at his absolute best cool intelligent unbeatable smart quick and also human and generous the closeups the slow motions with his amazing face expressions and his moves the way he walks they all add to the intensity of the plot i admired the way the movie was shot fast scenario great choice of music and kickass scenes that made me feel so satisfied because he took justice in his hands and wiped out the rotten mafia up to its core and got away with it gerard butler did the same in abiding law citizen though the ending was unfortunate loved everything in this movieat last a movie to feel ecstatic about,0.9878,1
If you are into vigilante justice movies like Boondock Saints then you will like this. I did and I recommend this.,cosmo_tiger,29 December 2014,8,one day somebody does something unspeakable to someone else to someone you hardly knew and you do something about it cause you can robert mccall washington is a mild mannered employee at homemart he spends his days helping his friends and spends his nights reading at a cafe where he talks to teri moretz a call girl robert like to live a quiet life but when he sees wrongs he fixes them the only way he knows how when something happens to teri he decides he cant sit back any longer and unleashes his own brand of justice i had pretty high expectations for this movie because denzel washington doesnt make bad movies i have to admit that i did really enjoy this and i highly recommend this but it was a little slow in some parts the only real flaw with the movie is that is seemed to start in the middle and you are trying to play catch up for the first half that said i did kind of like that rather than being spoonfed the plot like most movies do on the other hand this is yet another movie that liam neeson usually does this one has a different actor i thought man on fire was better but this was still very good if you are into vigilante justice movies like boondock saints then you will like this i did and i recommend this overall a good movie that was just a few steps away from being great i give this a high b,0.9973,1
"Disappointingly sterile, emotionless, Chuck Norris style acting.",imabean,13 December 2014,3,robert mccall is a humble big box hardware store employee with an extensive background in the cia he has a few coworkers with whom hes superficially friendly but they know nothing of his secret life until the latter half of the movie he befriends a young woman working as a prostitute for the russian mob and upon seeing their brutality against her he goes to bat on her behalf and goes to the russians hq to offer them to leave her alone the russian pimp and his associates dont care for the offer and the first mêlée of the movie ensues and of course denzels character emerges victorious and unscathed stopping his stopwatch once the carnage has concluded throughout this movie the robert mccall character is literally a stonefaced killer whereas the original british character from the equalizer tv series played admirably by the late edward woodward is a vigilante helping all sorts of underdogs with his trade craft and connections this robert mccall focuses primarily on just the one woman who needs a hand the original expressed emotion had a much richer tapestry of a background whereas this one is pretty bland the character is as twodimensional and stark as his rather spartan apartment i dont recall seeing an actor as lacking in emotions and facial expressions since chuck norris some of the confrontations mccall has with the russians seems to hearken back to denzel washingtons exemplary role as former cia operative john creasy in the remake of man on fire directed by the late tony scott but are far less visceral whereas creasy exacts furious vengeance upon one corrupt official after another whether by cutting ones fingers off one by one or annihilating them with rectallyinserted explosive mccall uses handson martial arts to dispatch his foes creasys acts are fired by emotion but mccalls dont seem fired up all that much at all i thought for a bit i was watching a black terminator even when mccall has a corrupt cop trapped in his own car at his own home exhaust pumping in and the cops life in his hands he is passionless and methodical i felt no compelling reason to cheer mccall on no reason to root for him as i did john creasy in the final confrontation with the russian hit squad the action is sterile and uninspired mccall is in his element in a way finding propane tanks and nail guns and other stuff like a black macgyver in his workplace to take out the bad guys but this is not at all what id expect from antoine fuqua after seeing the kind of badass action his characters dealt in training day some odd trivia in the first half of the movie specifically when mccall is wearing ear protection and sawing plywood you might recognize a few bits of the score from man on fire just briefly in the final scene theyve recycled mobys hit song new dawn fades used in the movie heat by michael mann in the im glad i didnt pay to see this,-0.9864,0
Batman meets Rambo meets Liam Neeson and they are black = The equalizer (MUST WATCH),centinela90,13 October 2014,9,have you ever though what would batman rambo o liam neeson roles would look like if they were all black well this movie answers the question this is a mustsee movie for every action fan who enjoys liam neeson crime genres such as taken if you would like to see someone seriously kicks ass to the russian mafia this is your movie the scenes has a lots of adrenaline and denzel washington acting is great i would recommend not to watch the trailer before this movie because it will make the twist of the story even more unexpected and enjoyable,0.9147,1
"If someone has a problem and have nowhere else to turn, they can call The Equalizer to make things right",moviexclusive,27 September 2014,8,yup although irish actor liam neeson has taken on baddies in countless movies in case you didnt know the oscarwinning actor will be threatening to hunt you down over the phone in taken next year we still dont think he cuts it as an uncle action hero now one guy wed root for is year old denzel washington the two time academy award winner best supporting actor for s glory and best actor for s training day is known for his portrayals of real life personalities like human right activist malcom x and middleweight boxer rubin hurricane carter but he is also a bona fide action hero look no further than his illustrious filmography man on fire the taking of pelham the book of eli and unstoppable are just some of the new yorkborn actors finest works here he teams up with his training day director antoine fuqua to play well a violent man the movie is rated for violence and coarse language out to eliminate baddies and it is one exhilarating ride indeed washington plays mccall a middle aged retired intelligence officer who believes he has put his special forces past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new quiet life but when the calm and collected man meets a young girl under the control of violent russian gangsters he decides to help her armed with some really impressive skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would bully the helpless mccall comes out of his self imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened based on the tv series starring edward woodward the film adaptation retains the basic theme of a kind stranger helping those who cant help themselves but triples up on the violence something we feel will go down well with fans of action movies we love this minute movie because we like washington and we watch in delight seeing him kick some booty without washington this would be an average movie but trust the award winning actor makes the character come to life he is intimidating and dangerous he is also cool with a steely resolve in the face of danger who doesnt want a hero always promising to bring the bad guys to the house of pain without needing to yell hysterically about it washington has the perfect intensity to make the action feel explosive this movie is a sure hit with guys the antagonist played by new zealand actor marton csokas he was lord celeborn in the first and third films of the lord of the rings series is scarily effective watch the demonically tattooed villain lurk around in his slick skyscraper while getting vexed and sadistic before getting his troops to destroy mccall elsewhere chloe grace mortez if i stay kick ass expands her choice of film roles by playing a young prostitute who ends up being a punch bag fuqua who staged some really beautiful shots in his previous works s tears of the sun s olympus has fallen doesnt have as many opportunities for breathtaking visuals but he frequently finds unique camera perspectives and lighting techniques to make the film look like a higherclass action blockbuster the film starts to get a bit longer than necessary at the final act revenge thrillers rarely cross the two hour mark but the action makes up for the length we want to shout out to the equalizer go kick some ass,0.9967,1
"cool,tense,interesting film",sipov,28 September 2014,8,this is a really cracking film not the runofthemill action plot i was expecting a very pleasant surprise the main character developed quiet slowly and was worth the patience of the viewer his back story was not laid out on a plate for you much was held back and only hinted at a genuinely cool reserved character in the old sense this is very refreshing and proves that it is as much what you leave out as put in that makes an interesting film the main bad guy dark hair in the film was riveting and as sinister as he was interesting you can see some plot areas coming but as ever wanted to see how he was going to get out of this one it doesnt disappoint i couldnt help having a bit of a giggle to myself that a good alternative title for the film would be showdown at bq in the uk this was only a small momentary laplse of reason on my part and in no way should detract from the serious nature and quality of the film again another great film located in boston im not sure why but it has a different dark side to it and seems a good backdrop for a thriller heist mob related film as well as dealing with the everyday details of the main character it also wasnot afraid to expand out to the bigger picture towards the end always the sign i think of a good well balanced film more importantly one which doesnt insult your intelligence too much a film that i get the feeling has learned from the mistakes and lessons of other films that i may have not seen it jumps just that little bit ahead of what i was expecting this gives it an interesting edge a great enjoyable film,0.9938,1
Not your average action film.,bardia-moose,28 September 2014,8,let me begin this review by saying that ive never seen the equalizer tv show so this review will be based on how i thought of the movie alone this isnt the first time director antoine fuqua and actor denzel washington have worked together training day was a film that produced a best actor for denzel so i was particularly excited for the two reuniting in an action film however this aint your average action film fuqua really knows how to direct compelling action with an artistic framework hes not like other directors who feel the need to unnecessarily shake the camera to hide the atrocious fight choreography and create cheap adrenaline he actually uses the action to tell the characters story you learn more about washingtons character through his fighting than you do through his dialogue the film also had a strong antagonist played by marton csokas who had as much screen presence as the protagonist himself which most action films lack however like i said before this aint your average action film all that and a riveting action sequence that takes place in a hardware store should be enough to get your blood pumping for days on end,-0.0841,0
What was Denzel thinking...|?,soupster1,31 December 2014,2,i dont mind rubbish if its entertaining rubbish i dont even mind lazy film making if its at least on a par with other cheap entertainments but this is garbage im especially disappointed that denzel washington was in this indeed i feel sorry for all the other actors jobbing or otherwise who clearly did their best with this cheap imitation of a film my general rule of thumb for a bad movie is that i could have written it in this case i could have written this when i was years old formulaic robotic unimaginative as exciting as unwrapping a new toilet roll all i wanted was a half decent movie that delighted me with feelings of revenge justice and juvenile type pleasing violence instead i got pretentious posing a ludicrous set up and enough clichés to last me a lifetime denzel washington is far better than this turkey,0.9103,1
Never Judge A Book By It's Cover,jamillah2,20 October 2014,9,this movie was awesome you should never judge a book by its cover because people are not always what they appear to be i purposely do not watch movie trailers so nothing is spoiled when i actually see the film therefore i was in shock when robert took out slovi and his crew wow he was the man i always love a storyline where a good guy rids the earth of bad people and negativity by any means necessary dexter denzels character robert was one cool dude who unconventionally rid our streets of trash his methods were necessary because the people he was dealing with were animals i loved it it was also great to see that it was filmed in boston though most of the actors made horrible attempts at the new england accent lol oh well great movie and i look forward to seeing it again,0.9698,1
Washington Really Does Best With Action!,ShelbyTMItchell,10 October 2014,9,i remember the tv show with the late great edward woodward as really the movie gets background details about him than the tv show even though nobody could ever match up with mr woodward mr denzel washington does him service as quiet and soft spoken robert mccall who used to be a black oops specialist but wants to put aside his life that he admits he is not proud of due to his late wife and work at a home depot like store and helping out a friend to become a security guard over in boston ma but when chloe grace montez character a prostitute gets involved with russian mobsters mccall cant stand idly beside on the sidelines and uses those skills of his to try to defeat them a one man army but then must deal with the baddest of them all named teddy along with several corrupt cops on the payroll great acting that doesnt sell out for the action with washington and great support along the way,0.9849,1
One of the best action films in a while,samsoknite,30 September 2014,8,when i first sat down to watch this film i came in with little expectations i hadnt seen the tv series it was based off and i hadnt read up at all on the plot i saw the trailer it looked interesting and when i left i had felt a certain pleasure that i rarely feel when watching a film the equalizer is easily a contender for being one of the best action films in a long while safe to say that denzel washington nailed the role as the lead character and the supporting roles especially the antagonist were equally well done what we have here is an action film with the right stars a solid plot and superb cinematography to match perhaps a particular favourite was the creativity in action scenes it felt real i didnt stop for a moment to think no way could that happen i felt the same for the characters not a single one was out of place particularly the main character whom you never really know much about his past remains a mystery it might seem cliché from that perspective and i know some are going to be shocked as i was at the plots progression it was simply well done it made sense it paced fantastically and it ended fine when it comes to an action film starring denzel washington i dont think you can get it better than that as far as criticism goes there is a specific character who i will not spoil that acts as the primary catalyst for the films events i personally felt the resolution was redundant and that the character existed solely as a plot device her acting was great however,0.9849,1
Don't Eat Pringles or Other Junk Food!,cpollis,30 September 2014,8,whats not to enjoy a greatlooking africanamerican protagonist played with intelligence grace and wit by denzel washington who is unassuming but very very clever concerned about what he and others put into their bodies by way of food erudite fastidious and committed to righting situations for a few decent acquaintances trying to improve their lives against long odds this guy thinks outside the box when up against russian mafia evildoers and is merciless in inflicting punishment for bad deeds as others have said it is comic book violence and very gruesome at times but there is still creativity in the execution in keeping with the savvy of our hero two hours of pure entertainment,0.7089,1
Denzel is like a black Jamie Foxx,xgabrielchastainx-427-835287,5 October 2014,4,but the movie was pretty poor i get what they were trying to do but why bother its been done so many times already its been done a lot better elsewhere hell its been done better elsewhere by denzel washington watching him in this is like watching muhammed ali getting knocked senseless by nobodies at the end of his career or seeing rubens barrichello lapping michael schumacher fortunately there wasnt too much of that im too old for this rubbish its bad enough when aging action starts try to relive their youth but worse when they have to constantly make excuses for why they suck chloe moretz is pretty lame in this too all the promise she showed as a little kid has come to nothing since her acting is no better now than then only now there is no excuse it happens shes going the way of christina ricci and will be appearing topless in a zombie movie in the nottoodistant future,-0.872,0
Fuqua and Washington Deliver Big Time,DareDevilKid,16 December 2014,8,reviewed by dare devil kid ddk rating stars with antoine fuqua behind the cameras and denzel washington dispensing justice the equalizer is a highly stylized violent and engaging action film that delivers on many counts fuqua infuses the film with a lowkey energy and is in no hurry to rush into things which is something many action films nowadays could learn from in the equalizer denzel washington plays mccall a man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new quiet life but when mccall meets teri chloë grace moretz a young girl under the control of ultra violent russian gangsters he cant stand idly by he has to help her armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless mccall comes out of his selfimposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened if someone has a problem if the odds are stacked against them if they have nowhere else to turn mccall will help though the plot looks familiar this familiarity can be welcome when the practitioner is so good at what he does and there are few actors more commanding than washington perhaps only neeson and wahlberg among post action stars when hes taking out bad guys washington as always holds your attention finding in mccall a vulnerability that goes beyond the scripts lip service denzels performance and the films highvoltage action premise make it one to watch this fall season the equalizeris without a semblance of doubt fuquas most accomplished effort along with s training day and s olympus has fallen and should give its veteran action star his very first movie franchise along with john wick the equalizer is the best rrated stylish brutal gory adultskewed action film to emerge from the hollywood stable this year,0.8849,1
"Great movie, from great TV-series.",teme-liimatainen,18 December 2014,8,first i watched the movie and thought what a great movie i hope theyll do a tvseries out of it went to imdb and remembered they already have in mid s i remember watching them all in my teens movie wasnt totally different well not at all after remembering the old tvseries main lead was and i dont mean denzel being black but he still doesnt strike me as an old man as was the tv robert sorry edward woodward grey and all although original wasnt as gruesome and bloody but still nice summary from the tvseries where robert hardly every used a gun to solve the problems and always put normal everyday people first all in all great movie adaptation,0.8312,1
One of Denzel's best works,monstermayhem32,27 September 2014,8,i would say that denzel gives one of his best works on the film as robert mccall an ex cia agent who wants to put behind his cia does and live a quiet life while helping those in need one night robert merts a girl named elena played by chloe grace moretz who reminds me of jodie foster when she played a hooker in taxi driver one night robert finds out that elena was beaten up rather badly by one of her clients and takes it upon himself to seek justice for her his own way by going after those that intimate and threaten others while offering life lessons to those in need who seek his wisdom i would have to say what makes robert a complex hero who is forced by dire circumstances to become something that he is not but while still maintaining his sense of right and wrong,0.0772,1
"Moral of the story is: Don't mess with Obama, I mean Denzel",athena-j-dennis,15 December 2014,9,obamai mean denzel swings some seriously massive and intimidating american penis against russian mafia in this film in all seriousness though this film is totally awesome it features great actor denzel washington who does have an uncanny resemblance to the president he is the man not to be messed with in this film the narrative pits an unethical evil and corrupt russian underground with a righteous courageous and overall good american hero denzel this was a narrative of good versus evil that was very popular in other films during the cold war era therefore its hardly surprising given the recent political events in russia and the ukraine that this film is also very much following along that well trodden path although i am making it sound as though its clichéd it is actually a good film and denzel is always great to watch on screen of all of the shoddy action films out there i would rate this one highly which is surprising as im a woman and i normally absolutely hate action movies,0.907,1
Fuqua fails again,FabledGentleman,12 January 2015,3,this is basically a reboot of man on fire which was also starring denzel washington the equalizer is a dumb unoriginal and boring movie with all the classic elements of a bmovie the stereotype badass russian gangster boss that earns more money than bill gates and warren buffet combined it seems needs to be put down by the ex cia american anti hero which only wants justice his own way puke olympus has fallen was a disaster of a movie where north koreans attack the white house and all the clichés known to man was presented after one another in this movie its the russians living in the us with their drug money and their bad attitude taking advantage of the great american country and its hospitality those damn mean russians yeah i see where you are going with this fuqua so whos the badguys in your next movie iranians or did you already make a movie with them if only the acting was inspiring or the story had something interesting to tell if only they showed something new if only the dialogue was anything close to creative if only the script writers knew what they were doing if only fuqua could learn how to direct speaking of that he seem to have taken the same path as shyamalan except fuqua never made a really awesome movie training day was ok but noting more well this is a bad action movie it starts off really good for like minutes i enjoyed it quite a lot it promised something and then it just turns out to be the lovechild of taken and man on fire bad,0.2417,1
It glued me to my sofa; can't walk away even the nature's called.,hitzujaa,10 May 2017,10,it is not a runofthemill rotm action movie with ton of explosions and gun fires it is one of a kind generally speaking rotm action movies always hurry to tell watchers who is a guy and his background and also his motivationreason of action that is almost tell us everything then nothing left is be explained and he just shoots at everything that moves on the other end of the spectrum this movie tells us nothing oh he is just an employee in home mart at boston well it seems that he enjoy his job but not his life whats next he might have something in his mind or a ghost form the past perhaps the director antoine fuqua and writer richard wenk just know how not to be spoonfeeders if denzel washington is white he is very fit to agent role i have got nothing else to say but it is mustwatch film,0.598,1
Denzel's Acting Is Amazing,arobinson0182,19 March 2015,10,the right of seriousness is in this movie and the funny parts in this movie is enjoyable his acting is solid he plays good guys well and plays bad guys well denzel has great intelligence when he acts i got more and more interested as the movie went on i like how denzels character is smart respectful and likable that also fights when he needs too the way he helped people was nice and the way have gave good advice to people he knew and met felt kind denzel can play these roles good lets see anything i dont like about it um well the movie did not show what happened to the store where his character worked but its not a big actually no problem at all i cant think of any reasons why i dont like the movie i was too busy enjoying the movie,0.9818,1
It is the depth of the Characters as brilliantly woven together by A. Fuqua that Earns a 10 from me.,Relkinlaw,10 August 2016,10,this movie is about the war of good and evil the transformation of the hero denzel from killer to protector and his ardent wish to be in the service of gooda redemption from his black ops background i believe it is the subterranean nature of this conflict that makes him an antihero his past was something he describes only to teddy ive done a lot of bad things in his life things for which i am not proud the use of violence by dw in his past is unquestionably evil and a disease from which he suffers he is unable to sleep and dream and from which he must find redemption clear ref to bush era of targeted assassinations imprisonment and rendition of huge numbers of violent men taken to black sitesfor money and never based on any evidence thus he planned his death to avoid destroying his soul because he knew the things he was told to do were fundamentally evil there was never any real basis for their death or imprisonment nor was the bush admin ever able to do anything but lie about the use of violence thus with violence coopted by the government for whom he worked he is a man who has lost any faith that his work had or could have a moral basis we meet dw in this shadowy world of dreams he reads the old man and the sea by hemingway and don quixote by cervantes and the reason he is doing this is spiritual he keeps a connection with his wife recently having passed through this dreamworld of fiction she had begun moreover the old man has no name yet he fights forces of nature to be himself don quixote fights for freedom in a time when his abilities are out of sync with the nature of the times so too dw learns that he is both men thus when he returns he plans and executes his own death and is symbolically reborn by destroying true evil,-0.9929,0
an equalized john wick?,kokorikos,4 March 2017,9,if u ask me which is better john wick or the equalizer i ll say with no hesitation the equalizerthe hero is a badass too yes kicking asses putting traps predicting everything but its denjel a good actor and the movie has a plot a believable plot although some clichés are here tooin fact the entire story is upon denjel s shouldersand he made it his fight style is also natural and well performed and not gun fights and shot heads like wick sthe villains are also believable in their partwell i enjoyed it,0.933,1
Equal to what -predictable sugar or the substitute,coimedia,27 September 2014,4,the equalizer is a formula movie i guess the actor was in between doing something interesting it was cute to see him save russian hookers if that is your idea of living vicariously though a lot of psychotherapy as to why you will never make it he seems to be lost in a giant hardware store like the ones we all go to of course what a better place than there to have action scenes like chasing people it was sort of superman without the cape and tights basically mr washington is predictable and although remotely interesting you know exactly what is going to happen he wins every fight just like superman and no one is even close to beating him the writers do show a few levels of creativity with how to kill the bad guys they seem to neglect the obvious of using identity theft which seems to be the biggest scare we all have when using our credit card in a store like that robert stack,0.7845,1

Thrilling,The-Sarkologist,11 June 2018,8,i must have missed this film when it came out and in a way its a bit of a shame because it is actually a pretty cool film come to think of it it did remind me a lot of the television series chuck but only in the sense that the protagonist happened to be this black ops specialist who was working in a bunnings style hardware store well not quite black ops because he has retired but in many ways he still seems to be set in his ways anyway he has this habit of going to an all night diner around am to have a cup of tea and he even brings his own teabag they just supply the water so he strikes up this conversation with this girl over time and it soon turns out that she has landed up in a bit of trouble she happens to be a prostitute but not one that is doing it willingly and her pimps are basically treating her as a disobedient possession as such he decides to go and teach them a lesson well he is polite at first but these type of people tend to be so cocksure that he eventually shows them who they are actually messing with well one doesnt simply walk into a restaurant owned by the russian mob and pretty much take everybody out without drawing some attention to yourself and this is basically what happens a highly trained special forces operative who happens to be the guy that cleans up messes for the mob boss comes over to the united states to find out what is going on well i guess you can probably see where this is going it isnt really one of those fast paced movies at least at first but that has more to do with the cat and mouse nature of the protagonists both are quite highly trained soldiers though one of them doesnt like to let it on while the other seems to want to show off his skill any change he gets it seems to relate to the various types of power relations soft power and hard power one rules by the first while the other simply rules through what he doesnt do we obviously suspect who comes out on top in this particular movie but then again the ending is generally pretty much set out right from the beginning i guess this film touches on a few things but once again it seems that the russians are being painted as the enemy even if it isnt a hangover from the cold war it does seem to create this stereotypical image of the brutal and hard russian who lives by his own rules once again they seem to be taking upon the mantle of the bad guys and even if they arent kgb they are russian mafia but the difference is that they tend to be somewhat less refined however when compared to other mafia group they do come across as the more brutal and nasty of them yet it was still a pretty cool movie and there were a couple of little subplots thrown in as well which all tie up nicely in the end however one interesting thing is that they dont always show our protagonist acting sometimes such as when he went after the armed robber there is only an implication of what actually happened we know he found him but we dont know what he actually did to him we just know that he eventually got what he wanted this was well done in a way its a pretty cool movie and certainly worth watching though one of the main reasons i wanted to watch it was because i saw a preview for the sequel where he happens to be posing as an uber driver,0.8266,1
Equalizer Is Better Then My Expectations,raptorsanford,9 May 2024,8,the equalizer is nothing like i expected which isnt a bad thing by the way i sat down watching it and the first scene with robert using his superhero like ability where he sees in the room i was just in complete shock because it was something i wasnt expecting out of that movie also robert definitely has ocd right because theres moments that feels like he does they pay a lot of focus to it specially at the diner its a really unique and interesting plot where hes just trying to get people peace and help them achieve what they want to be even in the beginning of the movie hes trying to help ralphie get a job as security its a really fun movie i gotta say this is a movie that ill watch again whenever possible,0.931,1
Modern Adaption of the 'Man-With-No-Name' Theme,MovieGuyFunTime,13 April 2021,8,this is a good modern take on the strangercomestotown and kills all the bullies theme probably most paralleling the story line in clint eastwoods pale rider perhaps the story is familiar but it is always a satisfying one if done well still with knowing basically how its all gonna go down the mystery is in the various characters who are all wellwritten and mostly multidimensional there are some nice touches that lend to the mystery of the characters the acting and directing is very good and the action scenes are superb there were also some very powerful though subtle moments that really gave the film weight such as denzels passing reference to don quixote the book he is currently reading which helps set up his motivation still somehow it feels like this kind of movie is not a denzel washington vehicle he does a very good job but it was not the kind of role i immediately accepted him playing the equalizer was good but suffered from several detracting plot holes that were entirely unnecessary and not required to move the story they should have been done differently and some not at all these were big distractions for me that maybe others overlooked but they stood out and quickly diminished the overall film in my estimation these are why does the cop locked in the car depend on denzel to roll down his window so he can breath why doesnt he just open the door last i checked you can easily get out of a locked car simply by opening the door andor pressing the unlock button from inside they went for some kind of unique sadistic styleplay here that fell flat on the grounds of logic how does denzel use the cops credentials to access the cops safe deposit box at the bank the cop is white all banks require photo id and matching signature of the box holder to access a safe deposit box even if they know you personally it is the law and they have to log it nobody can access your safe deposit box unless they are preapproved by the owner of the box i guess they figured nobody watching this film would actually have a safe deposit box fail denzel puts various canisters of combustible items in a microwave while the power is out when the bad guy enters the room with the microwave denzel reconnects the power the microwave starts cooking and sec later boom the canisters explode killing the bad guy who on gods green earth makes a microwave oven that starts cooking as soon as power is connected to it essentially as soon as it is plugged in stupid the drill did the bad guy back up into it off screen it doesnt show denzel pushing it forward into the guys skull so how did it penetrate who just stands there and lets someone drive a drill bit into their skull anyway and the nail gun no nail gun works like that in a society where lawn darts have been taken off the market for safety reasons we have nail guns that are equivalent to heavilyregulated hand guns do i need to pass a criminal background check to purchase that nail gun why buy a regular gun when you can buy a nail gun and kill people then build their coffins with the same tool after he kills the first baddie in the home mart why didnt he take the bad guys gun it is just there hanging on his body for the taking but denzel leaves it and prefers to kill them in other more creative ways the sad thing is that none of these logic problems were necessary to tell the story they were all just gee whizz moments that were intended to show how clever and smart our hero is but instead it only shows how gullible and stupid the writers think the audience is if theyd just left these scenes out or done something more believable but maybe not as mcgivery the film would have not slipped into ateam goofiness this handful of mistakes unfortunately and unnecessarily detract from an otherwise engaging and immersive film one nice surprise on the dvd special features was the spoof commercial for home mart staring denzel demonstrating the use of various helpful tools this was a hoot and made up a bit for the braindead moments mentioned above still a good movie but given all the other qualities of the film that were done so well it is a puzzler how these few really stupid moments made it to the final cut,-0.5749,0
"By the numbers, generic paycheck film for all involved",TheMarwood,15 December 2014,4,denzel washington brings nothing but his availability to show up and sleepwalk through filming playing a character that requires practically nothing from the man but look serious this is a step up in craft from director antoine fuquas previous film the sloppy olympus has fallen but despite being competently made the equalizer feels like lazy paycheck work theres nothing that you havent seen a million times before here and the generic story unfolds without so much as a single surprise this is by the numbers stuff its not a chore to sit through which is about the highest compliment i can give it but the second any character is introduced you know exactly how they will be used in the plot and their fate they are either simply good or bad no development beyond that add to that a horribly miscast chloë grace moretz despite an ending you can see minutes into its bloated minute running time a tacked on set up for a future franchise of more vigilantism feels forced and undeserving cant wait for his next adventure against a group of ethnic clichés who wronged a hapless girl while hes trying to make good at a dead end job,-0.9489,0

Law Abiding Citizen Meets Taken! Denzel Rocks! Phenomenal,louisc1987-184-556240,13 December 2014,9,after watching the trailer for the equilizer i was pretty pumped to watch the movie in the cinema but didnt get round to it i watched it yesterday and must say even though i thought it would be good judging from the trailer reviews and concept of the movie i was blown away by how much better it actually was denzel was immense in that vigilante role and played it to the bone in every way possibly it was also great to see denzel doing all of his own stunts and fight scenes instead of seeing your action man in one scene kicking butt to then changing into a completely different person the next the revenge storyline we have all seen before but the way denzel portrays his role makes it even better in this film the villain played martin cskoas was really top draw too all the actors played there role perfect and the action scenes were superb overall it was a great movie without hardly any movie mistakes it reminded me of law abiding citizen meets taken,0.9871,1
Best Bad Ass Movie ever possibly IMHO,mrozman-1,18 February 2017,10,great story and the character build up was done so well with this movie that you cant help but get sucked in and love denzel the story is unique but it has to do with the timing of the release its possibly that this movie would be just another one of those types of movies which i cant state as i dont want to spoil anything then end is very well done which is hard to do as a lot of movies are ruined by the very fact that they dont hit the bulls eye sometimes they come close and sometimes they completely miss the mark with this movie i think they hit the bulls eye so you have a good movie and a good ending no one will not enjoy this movie and if youre a denzel fan it may become your favorite now i want to watch man on fire again and i will definitely be watching this movie again this goes into the family movie library,0.9021,1

One man show,ahegde3149,4 April 2015,4,the equalizer is just another generic and stylized hollywood action thriller powered by its lead man denzel washington the story is nothing new and blandly predictable only a person who has never watched a hollywood action film in his entire life would like this screenplay denzel washinton plays a mysterious man in his named robert who seems to possess highly professional skill sets of cia agents type he is seen settling with a peaceful normal life till he crosses path with a young girl alina chloe gracemoretz alina is a prostitute and is need of serious help when she is badly beaten by some arrogant client and faces threats from her mobster russian bosses steps in our superhero the equalizer cleaning up the bad guys in matter of seconds the mob kingpin in russia pushkin sends his best skilled man teddy marton csokas to get rid of our hero and the battle begins honestly i felt the pacing was slow and boring whenever there was no action involved talking of the action our hero seems to have solution to any situation just like liam neeson in taken and at the end of the we all know what is the outcome of the story despite many of its shortcomings i must admit both denzel washingtons acting and character were both kickass and very much likable robert a man who is willing to help anyone in trouble and lives a simple selfless life who wouldnt like such a person the action scenes were cool ignoring the clichéd slowmotion shots the way robert examines the situation before he strikes was awesome the bad guy teddy was nothing more than typical russian bad guy in hollywood films chloes role felt more like a guest appearance rather than supporting the background score was bit too melodramatic overall i felt the film was quite boring i would suggest this film only for action lovers who want the protagonist to come out unscathed magically from any situation and beat the hell out dozens of bad guys single handed and also for fans of denzel washington others should not bother rating,0.6742,1
great movie!,coltonboswell195,12 February 2015,9,when i first watched this movie i didnt have very high hopes for it but i was surprisingly shocked on how well the story was written even though its your standard revenge movie and yes it was a little slow in the beginning but it all pays off after about minutes into it and boy it does not let off on the action and suspense i highly recommend this movie has great characters awesome action scenes and a pretty good sound track only problem like i said is it is slow on some parts but overall this is a good movie to just sit and relax while munching on popcorn i was not disappointed at all with denzels performance stars,0.9901,1

Excellent reboot of the TV series - Denzel delivers again,jb_campo,9 May 2015,8,i was a big fan of this tv show i was excited to see this reboot and especially with denzel as robert mccall a simple day worker at a big box home depot type store but with an unknown past denzel delivers in spades his character is very slowly revealed as a vigilante type who takes no crap from any bad guy who wrongs the simple hardworking common person on the street kind of like the charles bronson death wish series some of the interactions are funny especially with the other femme semilead young lady hooker who dreams of being a singer but is instead deep in over her head with russian bad guys well you know stuff is going to happen and when it does you want robert mccall on your side he takes on the russians and other bad guys the fight scenes are all slowmotion timed out choreographies that reveal part of denzels characters compulsion with organizing everything in his life you learn only a little about his past something to do with something powerful in some government agency but there are little details given other than the knowledge that this is a guy you do not mess with the ending leaves the sequel door wide open and i hope they follow this up while denzel is still young enough to do this action stuff one things for sure next time i go to home depot or lowes im going to look at the guys there muccccch differently enjoy this excellent action flick,0.9107,1

Action movie with purpose,brandonsullivan91,29 March 2015,8,i love the denzel great action flick so what it isnt a new concept but i never get tired of the righteous defender rescuing the defenseless from evil oppression if it is well done its a great story line to follow this one is well done when you need a night of low life punks getting obliterated sliceddiced shot with a nail gun cork screwed through the jaw this is the one to watch the interesting aspect for me is that every villain has an opportunity to stop his behavior before judgment its a really great picture of spiritual truth another powerful message comes through loud and clear we all have the ability to serve someone in need take a look around and you will see someone you can help,0.9528,1

The Equalizer - Review,parleon-thedon,3 February 2015,5,first and foremost ive never heard of the equalizer television series until i heard that hollywood was going to make a film based on it also ive never seen an episode of the equalizer and i probably never will to kick things off lets talk about mr denzel washington denzel washington is fantastic in this movie denzel has such a huge star presence every time hes on screen marton csokas ive never heard of this guy before but wow marton csokas i believe carried his on weight in this movie marton csokass character was menacing frightening and eccentric chloë grace moretz ive never seen her like this before chloes performance was good and different but she really didnt have anything to do this movie sure did waste chloës talent now on to the story the story is simple and easy to follow however its not the story im paying attention to im paying attention to denzel washington when you first see denzels character he plays it straight we dont know who this guy is or what he has done in the past when we first meet denzels character hes kind helpful sad and wants to help everybody but one day things change for denzels character there is one scene were we see denzel snap and its a very bloody and shocking moment however from there on in i feel the movie becomes repetitive boring and clichéd some of the dialog i feel is a bit cringe worthy however when denzel says some of these completely foreshadowing lines i let it go because its denzel freaking washington the movie starts off good i didnt know what to expect when the violence starts im game but then it just carries on and it seems like denzels character is having to much fun with no real consequences,0.9142,1
For Mr.kahl's intro into films class😎,biggcountry,29 October 2015,10,the equalizer is a fantastic movie about denzel washingtonmccall who is a hired gun or was a hired gun for the government we dont fully know in this film and we dont truly ever find out what he was before we see him for the first time we just know by the way he takes care of business that he doesnt mess around if you havent already seen this movie in theaters you need to go down to the store and buy it right now the equalizer is a pretty straightforward movie no twists and turns no mystery nothing but blood and action this movie is a gory movie and it has been rated properly so if your thinking of taking your nineyearold son to go see this movie dont on the other hand id say if youre more towards the age of and up depending on the parent thisll be a great movie to go see with some friends i love this movie and i think youll love it too i give the out of stars,0.9841,1
BEST STORY AND BEST ACTING AND HUGE FAN OF DENZEL WASHINGTON,29Vishnoi29,1 June 2020,10,this movies story is best acting is best and im huge fan of denzel washingtons superb acting,0.9524,1
"Denzel Washington plays another badass, so what's not to love?",brchthethird,20 January 2015,8,directed by antoine fuqua and based on a s tv show which i havent seen the equalizer stars denzel washington as robert mccall a quiet man with a murky past who has a keen sense of justice and helps those in need while this film could have been a pulpy ultraviolent mess the team of antoine fuqua and denzel washington who previously collaborated on training day bring a sense of realism and attention to character that elevate this above your typical revenge action picture as the title character denzel washington brings gravitas and his usual coolness to the role of robert mccall hes a man of few words and also one who is methodical and precise he also has a good sense of right and wrong which is why he does what he does and not just in a violent way hes a very friendly man who helps his friends and coworkers in other ways as well ie training a fellow home mart employee for a security guard exam one thing i really liked was the way in which you could tell what he was thinking by him just giving a look and in fact we are introduced to him in a largely wordless opening sequence the film also stars chloe grace moretz as ilinateri an underage russian prostitute while she did a great job portraying her character she was little more than a plot device that springs mccall into action i should also mention marton czokas as teddy a russian heavy who is brought in to investigate after mccall kills several russian pimps in retaliation for putting ilina in the hospital of course after offering them a way out he was the only other character besides mccall who really had any depth and he brought a certain lethality and sadism to his character which contrasted nicely with mccall other than him all of the villains were expendable and generic which is unfortunate considering the quality filmmaking here bill pullman and melissa leo also appeared in glorified cameos as a friendly couple tied to mccalls mysterious past they werent anything special but it was nice to see them in the film regarding mccalls past though they dont really go into much detail but it wasnt too much of a big deal because it contributed to his overall mystique and kept the focus on his everyman persona as far as the action and technical side of the film it was wellstaged and shot and it looked like denzel did most of his own stunts the fights were up close and intimate but it was still possible to tell what was going on from shot to shot as well as having a good sense of geography however for the most part the violence was restrained and brutally efficient instead of lingering on it in a gratuitous way which was true to the character of mccall overall despite not delving too deeply into any of the characters but mccall the equalizer is a good examination of a downtoearth hero who does what he feels is right in order to level the playing field for those who are unable to help themselves theres also a nice submessage about being who you want to be in life and not letting others dictate that for you its one of the best action movies in a while and a great reteaming of antoine fuqua and denzel washington who appears here in top form,0.9946,1
Unexpected,nikki_khali_johnson,25 May 2015,10,i didnt get to see this at the movie theater but i did get to see this on hbo when i sat down to watch this movie i thought i knew how this movie would end based on the previous movies i have seen denzel in i was surprised completely i really liked this movie i thought it was really clever denzel has always been a very serious actor so it was no surprise when i saw his part in this movie it is always such a pleasure to see him act his characters are so believable in some scenes the way the camera was positioned it gave the audience a surreal view of the actions from one of the characters views i only wish the audience would have been given a little more information about robert mccalls past life his character was such a mystery but i guess thats what makes his character so intriguing,0.9613,1
Generic Thriller Not Based On A TV Show,Theo Robertson,17 April 2015,5,oh the equalizer where a limey who used to work for the cia has now branched out in to freelance work where if you have a problem with criminals you can hire him and hell sort out the problem while taking a large fee while giving you long lectures about why its a bad idea to get involved in crime on any level including being a victim of crime if i remember correctly the show started forgetting to include the criminal angle and just became a social conscious show that went as far as equating a child who got hiv through blood products as being the same as an adult alcoholic the adult in this episode was conducting a violent lynch mob campaign against the child and his mother and youve got this type of moral equivalence being brought in to a show its time to bail out its probably a forgotten show in this day and age and if its remembered at all it will be remembered for a slightly misleading title sequence which gave the show a hook it didnt deserve and a great and funky theme tune by stewart copeland this is a film version of the series but isnt really the lead character is called robert mccall and thats the only real connection between this and the tv show mccall now works in a warehouse and gets involved with a prostitute involved with the russian mafia and this posse of russian bad guys are coming to america in order to have a monopoly on the american criminal dream in other words its a completely generic thriller where if you changed the name of the central character you would not for a moment fall out of your seat and gasp hey wait a minute this is just like that show from the nineteen eighties starring edward woodward i do hope for this film companys sake there arent any lawyers watching its also rather nasty and violent which again is not in keeping with the source material which was terminally talkative but this isnt necessarily a recommendation,-0.9834,0
A very good movie,THBrad89,29 July 2018,8,great movie until the last minutes dw further solidifies himself as one of the all time great actors if ending was more plausible i would have rated it a fist fight in store would not have happened and robert couldnt just hang out in the diner after these events but even with a weak ending it was very good looking forward to the sequel,0.5775,1
Man on Fire Just Came Of Age!,haphazard72,14 December 2014,9,loved it loved it loved it i loved man on fire but this takes it to a whole new level theres no doubt that you need to read between the lines and piece a few things together but overall a great movie denzel still has it even as he ages he played the dark horse really well and again in similar vane to man on fire he clearly has a past that is unknown to his friends chloe played a role years beyond her age another outstanding performer with a great future ahead of her whilst some might complain about the level of violence i wouldnt say its as bad or worse than many other movies out there now if you liked man on fire youll like this,0.9627,1
"Why Were You Born, Bob McCall?",lavatch,3 July 2018,9,the equalizer opens with a mark twain quote that gets to the heart of the mystery of the protagonist robert mccall the two most important days in your life are the day you born and the day you find out why in the course of the film we find out the answer to mr mccalls purpose in life namely to serve as a modern day robin hood and balance things about between good and evil in the world the film developed a compelling narrative with the excia black ops specialist mccall who has left his past behind and assumed a mildmannered role as a home mart employee and an avid reader of the classics following the death of his beloved wife vivian mccall has taken to reading the most famous books he is seen reading hemingways the old man and the sea and ralph ellisons invisible man but the most relevant is the one is the novel he only briefly describes to alina as a story of a medieval knight errant fighting for the causes of good in the world of course that novel is cervantes don quixote robert mccall is a much more effective redeemer and revenger than don quixote he takes on the russian mafia that has infiltrated the east coast enlisting corrupt boston policemen and american politicians and engages in human trafficking money laundering and other criminal activities the best line in the film occurs at the lavish estate of one of mr mccalls old cia colleagues when mccall pays a visit to her the cia official casually informs her husband he didnt come for help he came for permission the permission granted to him is to become a oneman wrecking crew of the nefarious nicolai itchenko and his associates plus the russian based ringleader vladimir pushkin the equalizer was welldirected with stunning location footage of sites in boston outstanding work with camera angles and effective pacing for a longish film one of the best scenes is a quiet conversation in a restaurant where mr mccall nearly teases out of his adversary nicolai itchenkoa confession that nicolai was the boy who killed his kind benefactors after adopting him and giving him a loving environment nicolai itchenko obviously found out who he was early in life but refused to change by contrast robert mccall recognized many ways that he could fulfill his destiny then shapeshifted his way to a sense of service to humanity one path was working in black ops one was working as the equalizer but another was in the simple act of lending a helping hand to those in need like alina the best part of the film was denzel washingtons complex interpretation of this multilayered role,0.9951,1

Fantasy diversion for the oppressed & downtrodden.,epat,10 February 2015,3,this is just another damn action movie but it could have been more denzel washingtons humble homehardware clerk character is way too nice to be believed tho that aspects far less improbable than his spectacular killing prowess once hes sufficiently riled by injustice the movie quickly devolves into a pointless cataloging of innovative techniques for killing nasty people using whatever comes to hand especially how to achieve lethal results wielding nothing more than common hardware superstore implements wow entertaining is it too much to expect maybe a shade of moral ambiguity anywhere here a bit more backstory yet look at the time wasted having him fly to washington to see his former supervisor just to establish that a he was once some sort of agent who b formerly did somethingorother for c some unspecified branch of the secret government i mean does that really add anything we hadnt already figured out for ourselves ok we do learn he once loved somebodyorother i think they may even have mentioned a name that she somehow died that he for some reason faked his own death how relevant is that and what about his quirk of timing everything he does he times how long it takes him to get ready to leave his apartment interesting character trait i admit but am i the only one left wondering how he got that way cmon dont be so lazy flesh it out a bit willya toogoodtobetrue heroes with mysterious backgrounds twodimensional bad guys are boring gimme a break this whitehatblackhat crap is old hat it went out with roy rogers just one more hollywood fantasy diversion a feelgood movie for the oppressed downtrodden thats a rapidly expanding demographic nowadays isnt it but hey it could have been more,-0.9636,0

An Excellent Watch. Do NOT Miss This.,dfa120374,30 May 2015,8,ive got to admit that i had my doubts about this film even after seeing the trailer for it not because it looked like just another overthetop actioner but because it didnt really strike me as a film worth watching boy was i ever wrong and im so glad i decided to watch it after thinking ah what the hellill give it a try the equalizer is actually one of the best recent action films that ive seen for a good while and everything from the direction and cinematography to the casting and action suspense is just so well done its very refreshing to watch an action film that has a credible enthralling story to it as well instead of some simple iq draining cliché filled tripe like the fast the furious there are a lot of good scenes throughout this film and i think i would be hard pushed to pick out just one that was better than any other in saying that though the slowmotion scenes were definitely some of the standout moments for me and were filmed perfectly capturing the calculating mind of mccall nicely the cast was spoton as well with denzel washington marton csokas and chloë grace moretz all doing bangup jobs with their characters washingtons portrayal of mccall was just nailed to perfection as was csokass performance as the vicious calculating russian mafia henchman nikolai teddy itchenko i think the only reason that stopped me from giving this film a higher rating was due to it being a wee bit slow in some places i know that to be a good action film you need to develop the story the characters and the mood for whats coming and while it succeeded in doing all of that it just felt a touch slow during some scenes thats a very minor point however and it in no way spoils any of the viewing if you havent seen this film then youre definitely missing out on an absolute gem great cast well written and full of action suspense what more could you want,0.9971,1
Rewatch rewatch rewatch,mikayakatnt,5 March 2020,8,i hate that i dont hate this movie something about denzel washington and justiceporn that gets me coming back and back to this film especially when i see it playing on cable while at home the film is straightforward and takes no questions denzel washington is some exciasupersoldiersuperhumanwhatever that helps out good people and kills bad guys straightforward right action scenes were damn enjoyable and the ending was epic who else could kill with a nailgun and look so badass i was debating on giving this film a but ive rewatched it so many times that i think it deserves an extra star,-0.8052,0
In one word - badass,SindarS,27 July 2018,8,i liked how the movie led the viewer into the story without giving a full background of robert mccalls character played by denzel washington this way theres a little mystery lingering around him the whole movie and the viewer is given some bits and pieces that he or she can put together on their own that said the peaceful start of the movie goes south real fast once mccall pisses off the wrong people so he becomes the target himself one thing i can say for sure you dont want to find yourself on robert mccalls bad side i found this movie really entertaining as it kept me in suspense the whole time and also guessing what twist might come next the psychological battle between the protagonist and his nemesis was very well done so were the fight scenes which were brutal and merciless at times the ending and the resolution was a bit amusing to me since denzel unleashed his innermacgyver in order to deal with matters at hand i might get some strange flashbacks the next time i visit supplies retail store,-0.1118,0
Nothing More Then A Never Ending Video Game Cutscene,FilmMan47,10 February 2015,2,i will totally not go into any long discussions specially about this director antoine fuqua this man ruined chow yun fats hollywood debut in the replacement killers mrfuqua likes to ape john woo and video games too much anyone who has good taste in cinema or a fan of action films will agree after watching will end up saying this is a serious mess of a film plus i bet all doubts will be cleared about this director forget the cast i mean marton csokas reminds me of dougray scott he did good acting chole grace mortez appears with a hilarious makeup as a prostitute she looked more like harley quinn of dc comics here and finally danzel washington the finest actor of our times embarrassing himself here in the role of so called tough anti hero on par with man of fire and many justice revenge films like death wish series i have to agree with everyone who is saying john wick is better then this absolutely hell yes i have seen a lot of anti russian movies this was no surprise but the premise is so bad even more then a usual dolph lundgren movie but since it is based on a tv series of a same name from equalizer this adaptation fails to deliver i am sure that original tv show was not like this with the guy zooming in on bad guys suddenly he becomes max payne shooting everyone in less then seconds let us look the story here now ok this guy robert mccall leaves a violent past life behind living a good life then he gets involved in troubles of a girl teri after she gets beat up bad by russian bad guys who run some sort of escort service some pointless dialogs are between robert the villain teddy was annoying like you look at me what you see then i look at you and tell what i see how original the writer was on drugs i am sure this is a hour nonsense of boring drama and cgi action junk pipe lines blowing up denzel washington is using bullet time going slow motion the entire time he appears why dont bad guys have this mode the final fight is in a warehouse with hero winning by a nail gun i am sorry but i didt like this at all and man on fire is no good either it is tony scotts worst film ever his best last is top gun only but if anyone loves denzel washington try book of eli please it is his best ever besides what was denzel thinking when he signed the contract about time he should do a comedy film like i said before this film is nothing more then a never ending cut scene from a video game even if audience loves cheesy stuff this does not qualify least bit overall the equalizer is a waste of time money it provides heavy brain damage my rating is skipp it,-0.9122,0
A More Deliberate Jason Bourne,tabuno,11 January 2019,8,may teddy the cold and sinister character in the equalizer played by marton csokas had a similar role as a polished and sophisticated professional in the bourne supremacy facing matt damons famous elite and dangerous bourne character the equalizer has similar elements of the bourne series with its carefully choreographed physical scenes and relational interactions yet denzel washington is offered secretive role playing an even more common place character who only become even more creative in his use of every day instruments the is slow to build and the denzels character is allowed time to develop along with the simply normal everyday series of regular business day job activities and a somewhat obsessivecompulsive night light routine of staying up late and reading books at an all night café in the asian movie fashion denzels character is faced with a moral dilemma of becoming who he was and placing himself in danger and watching the innocent be abused and maimed for their desire to be what they want by movies end there is a surge of violence in intense but singular doses unlike the continuing big explosions and multiple slaughter on screen instead there is a deliberate and calculated almost methodical approach to a sort of moral physical justice that offers up one origination story for the original television series the focus of this movie is not so much on the spectacular special effects but a more cool sophisticated use of lethal behavior similar to liam neesons earlier taken,0.9628,1
A high quality action movie,paul-pezmail,1 January 2019,8,im not sure why it took me so long to watch this perhaps the hype surrounding it put me off or maybe my dislike of remakes but i was pleasantly surprised to find the equalizer to be a well written well directed and superbly acted action movie the pacing is excellent a little slower than most of the genre and with a measure of subtlety not usually found within it dont get me wrong im not saying this is the godfather or a matter of life and death but its a damned fine action flick as luc besson found with taken get a solid script and put a superb actor in the lead and you can raise the bar on the standard guntoting fare as you might expect the movie is violent often gory and some of the action a touch on the heroic side but its well enough done that it is believable and never for a moment takes the viewer out of the film highly recommended,0.9716,1
"Nice, tight flick",grehfeldt-85149,26 September 2016,8,the diner scenes appear in the longshots to be a shout out to hoppers nighthawks the eerie late night glow serves to accentuate mccalls restlessness and inability to sleep teri becomes vulnerable there and shares her interest in what he is reading rather than staying in hooker character and mccall dispatching of the hitman sent to kill him stresses the finality of his actions while the last scene in homemart is a little smaltzy with mccall dispatching the tactically armed bad russians with gardening tools fencing and a nail gun is a little incredible it is a statement on his inventiveness skills that have served him well in his blackop life leaving no loose ends he cuts off the snakes head and teri is allowed to return to a life she desires a well directed and shot picture that should keep you riveted to the screen,-0.9595,0
great action movie and an excellent omage to the 80's show,Mcduff3601,25 June 2018,10,i love this movie this is an action movie done right at least for me that is i find the pace the character development all of it is right on track its not perfect by any means but i just love watching bullies get whats coming to them and this movie delivers i liked how denzels character has got ocd and is meticulous kind of explaining his odd way of calculating how he is going to do the things he does there are no real surprises or twists here we are introduced to the characters told who is good and who is bad after that there is no explaining needed that the bad guys need a good ass kicking thats all this movie is watching good guys fight bad guys the way its done though works for me the music setting style and pace all make it an excellent movie that i think is worth watching again and again,0.1157,1
Hello? Is anyone watching? It's Apparent...We aren't.,Wifemakingmedoit,9 February 2015,2,this movie was recommended by a friend from work and he said to me top three this was because he had told me the movie was in his top favorite movies of all time after just finishing it i cant stop laughing about how much im going to ridcual him for suggesting it the movies plot has been churned out so many times did i just watch a new superhero a knight secret service man batman invisible man the spirit of jesus christ longest slomo kill sequence man oh i get itrepeat man spoiler alert folks i gotta cut to the chase on this onethere is no fancy ending there isnt a twist if youve seen armageddon and the other thousands of movies about revenge do not sit down do pass go and find something else to do the only good part of the movie when my wife suggested to watch a trailer for another movie nothing says awesome movie like trolling through other movies while you are watching another one if that isnt a single sign about how placid this movie is towards the end when the good samaritan security cop who was crying for some reason when denzel saved him and this is where batman comes into scene prior to that he was a cross between liono from the thundercats sight beyond sight or a perfect weapon shame on us for even considering this a star movie the scene where the old secret service lady was so intuitivemeant so much to really put the movie all together hes excia and needs approval from mr spaceball himself bill pullman after getting slammed in the face with cliché after cliché i asked my wife what is he doing i mean here is nice guy denzel eating his sandwich working for the man and what a week gone by and hes all the sudden russian balls deep in an international catch me if you can suspense what it also shows is our desire for meaningless violence of which this is i wonder if i can file a complaint,0.505,1
I loved it!,yoyo_hamblen,5 April 2015,10,i am disappointed with the negative reviews it seems some people just want to be critical and its not sporting denzel washington is great never does a bad movie to be totally honest always great value for money i heard he always chooses his movies very carefully and this fits straight into what he prefers good v evil where good must prevail i found myself really drawn in and very engaged when he assesses the threat capacity of his opponents there is something quite satisfying about the action he takes and i felt that i was on the journey with him as for previous comments who really cares if the russians were not authentic russians the casting was really good i prefer to view movies as pure entertainment and i think trying to critique everything or the authenticity of people places and story lines just takes the fun out of it its good fun enjoyable and dw at his best one to watch again,0.9904,1
"Meet the inverted Caspar Milquetoast, a man who speaks softly and hits with a mighty big stick.",rickhouska,21 November 2014,9,denzel washington plays the title role as robert mccall in this reincarnation of the edward woodward tv series there is no jaguar for mccall to move around nyc as a suave well dressed guy with a british accent instead washingtons mccall gets around boston by walking and public transportation he is a very average guy who keeps to himself lives modestly and works at home mart a hollywood version of home depot or lowes there he encourages coworker ralphie michael skourtis to lose weight and move up the ladder by becoming a security guard after work the mccall visits a local diner to eat read and occasionally discuss life calmly extolling the virtues of self discipline and healthy eating there we see also that he has become a genuine friend to a young working girl alina cloe grace moretz she asks questions about the book he reads and looks troubled in the first act we often wonder when mccall will show his aces washingtons nice guy character is introduced as quite passive and slow moving as it moves through several relationships with increasing drama and tension this reaches a peak when he confronts the russian mob who have beat the living crap out of alina mccall has come to the mobs restaurant to buy alina her freedom making an offer the boss slavi david meunier instantly mocks and refuses here finally we see mccall as the bad ass mf we have been impatiently expecting the camera and special effects go into high gear revealing him to be a calculating superhuman fighter who swiftly dispenses the heavily armed russians in an incredibly bloody and violent encounter now the die is cast pitting mccall against the big russian mob boss vladimir pushkin vladimir kulich who must retaliate and kill him to do this he employs teddy aka nicolai martin csokas his best and most ruthless lieutenant working with corrupt cops teddy methodically tracks down mccall hurting or killing anyone who gets in his way meanwhile more is revealed about mccalls past when he meets with mysterious cia characters who provide him with information and tools he requires to deal with the russian mob this version of the equalizer is quite compelling as was the original there are few of us who have not wanted an equalizer in our lives to deal with an actual bully predator or obnoxious asshole who seem beyond the reach of justice this is about a primal as it gets when you find yourself as as a victim with no defense so rooting for mccall is a piece of cake no matter how much violence he spawns and very uplifting potentially alas this fantasy ends when we leave the theater but maybe not if we keep wishing harder,-0.2321,0
Must Watch,nav-raj25,13 January 2015,10,last year when i saw movie flight i thought its best ever movie by denzel as i watched the equalizer i realized that there is nothing the best for a great actor like denzel every flick is great in its own way character robert mccall is a mysterious person and talks with eyes his acting shows how mature he is as actor its something thats earned over years marton csokas played brilliant role and he too is a mysterious character actual plot as i think is that lead character robert mccall is actually fighting with himself he saw his helplessness in that girl so he was actually fighting for himself to be out of his not so good past lead actors carried films so well that crowd will not think of logical things like hows and whys its a must watch in theater and i am sure the whole team of the equalizer will keep coming with excellent stuff like this one,0.9845,1

A missed opportunity,briandecarrun,31 January 2015,4,this could have been good the idea was good but between the script the lead actor strutting style and the mr invincible persona this in the end was quite poor and not even remotely believable makes james bond look true to life given the tv series had a measure of sense they seemed to have gone ott with this as while letting their lead do his brooding act at the start to then his arrogant cant touch me smart alec style denzel washington does his usual selfrighteous peacock acting and at no stage is there any suspense as this leads to a predictable ending without even anything that goes anyway off cue this is very disappointing as with a better script and a better actor he seems to have one style and thats it this could have been done better i think if superman batman and the marvel avengers all turned up washingtons character could beat them all up while drinking a cup of tea,0.7896,1

"Too much Vigilante, and it gets skirmish.",Dr_Coulardeau,23 January 2024,8,the actor is good and he is black which is very important in this context the context is urban crime and violence with no real effort from the police to do anything the only change from one film to the next is the type of crime otherwise it is always the same pattern crime passive police robert mccall tekes over this pattern is extremely dangerous for any audience it justifies the passivity of the police who cannot do anything because criminals today are stopping nowhere and have no limits hence they have a tremendous future then the second line is simple private citizens must be concerned and if they are they have to take over and just plain get rid of these criminals if we were in a western film a spaghetti western if you want the criminals would be white and that would be a family affair and as such other white people could take it into their own hands or the criminals would be indians and then in the good old western racist tradition kill them all and do not ask questions especially when they are all dead but here the popular vigilante is black and that creates a feeling of justice in the black audience and a feeling of fear in the white audience in both directions these films have it all wrong they create a problem more than they solve one not even cathartically because it is cathartic to no white audience that lives with the fear of a black upheaval and it is cathartic to no black audience that probably feels encouraged to become firmer stronger more aggressive by these black people who try to impose their rule and justice onto the whole society it goes even further when the criminals themselves are black imagine a white audience black criminals are everywhere and the police do nothing let them shoot them dead on the spot and whats more the vigilante is a black man then what do whites do here thats exactly why some people in the world start believing the west has been defeated or at best is being defeated because inside the western countries concerned in north america and europe the real rotting layer is under the feet of all westerners black white or any other color even blue or red like the donkey and the elephant of american egotistic democracy dr jacques coulardeau version française lacteur est bon et il est noir ce qui est très important dans ce contexte le contexte est celui de la criminalité et de la violence urbaines sans réel effort de la part de la police pour faire quoi que ce soit le seul changement dun film à lautre cest le type de criminalité sinon cest toujours le même schéma criminalité police passive robert mccall prend en main ce schéma est extrêmement dangereux pour tout public cela justifie la passivité de la police qui ne peut rien faire parce que les criminels daujourdhui nhésitent devant rien et nont aucune limite donc ils ont un avenir formidable ensuite la deuxième ligne est simple les citoyens doivent sinquiéter et sils sont inquiets ils doivent prendre le relais et se débarrasser purement et simplement de ces criminels si nous étions dans un western un western spaghetti si vous voulez les criminels seraient blancs et ce serait une affaire de famille et donc dautres blancs pourraient prendre les choses en main ou bien les criminels seraient des indiens et alors dans la bonne vieille tradition raciste occidentale tuezles tous et ne posez pas de questions surtout quand ils sont tous morts mais ici le justicier populaire est noir ce qui crée un sentiment de justice chez le public noir et un sentiment de peur chez le public blanc dans les deux sens ces films ont tout faux ils créent un problème plus quils nen résolvent un même pas de manière cathartique car cela nest cathartique pour aucun public blanc qui vit dans la peur dun soulèvement noir et cela nest cathartique pour aucun public noir qui se sent probablement encouragé à devenir plus ferme plus fort plus agressif par ces noirs qui tentent dimposer leur pouvoir et leur justice à lensemble de la société cela va encore plus loin lorsque les criminels euxmêmes sont noirs imaginez un public blanc les criminels noirs sont partout et la police ne fait rien quils les tuent surlechamp et en plus le justicier est un homme noir alors que font les blancs dans ce bas monde cest exactement pourquoi certaines personnes dans le monde commencent à croire que loccident a été vaincu ou au mieux est en train dêtre vaincu car à lintérieur des pays occidentaux concernés en amérique du nord et en europe la véritable couche pourrie se trouve sous les pieds de tous les occidentaux noirs blancs ou toute autre couleur même le bleu ou le rouge comme lâne et léléphant de la démocratie américaine du chacun pour soi dr jacques coulardeau,-0.9854,0
nothing special,dragokin,1 February 2015,3,the best moment in the equalizer is roughly one third into the movie where one of the main villains receives a phone call the camera follows him as he leans back into the armchair and we see his tattoos as someone has pointed out to me in a conversation this is where we understand he is a demon against which our hero fights however if you know that the hero is denzel washington going after vladimir pushkin it all dissolves into a thinly veiled propaganda in which obama would eventually defeat putin i think we dont need to discuss any depth after this point and focus on the fun factor but even there were confronted with questionable contents for example the aforementioned gentleman wears massive prison tattoos although he spent major part of his life in the military also our hero has a soft spot for girls in trouble although trained as an assassin he prefers everyday objects to execute his opponents and the most interesting thing is that roughly at the same time a movie with keanu reeves came out called john wick in which the main character goes after russian mob well it is not as good as the equalizer,-0.3115,0
The Equalizer - one man CAN make a difference,fact-n-fiction,15 December 2014,9,trying to live a quiet life robert bob mccall realises that he cannot simply sit idly by and let bad things happen to people he knows dont deserve it the premise is nothing new in fact i had seen most if not all of the series from the late eighties of the same name and wondered how denzel washington could possibly have been cast in the part of robert mccall a part formerly inhabited by the late edward woodward dont get me wrong i think denzel is a fine actor and thoroughly enjoyed other movies ive seen of his but somehow i just couldnt get the image of woodward out of my mind when thinking of the equalizer so it was with some trepidation that i sat down to watch this movie that boasted a running time of over two hours the beginning was slow and i wondered whether it was worth it this robert mccall seemed no more than an assistant in a diy store who enjoyed reading slept little and drank tea wasnt he apparently not when a young girl hed befriended in the allnight café he frequented is badly beaten by russian mobsters mccall decides its time he did something about it opening a can of worms even he wasnt expecting from mildmannered assistant mccall suddenly becomes someone who proves he will go to quite extraordinary lengths to get the job done standing up for the little guy or girl whoever happened to be benefiting from his help at the time despite its fairly pedestrian start this movie is a real rollercoaster of action and tension theres no shortage of violence much of which is bloody and brutal but i believe its necessary noone crossing the mob whichever nationality they may be would get away with a stern talking to or a slapped wrist its difficult to go deeper into the whys and wherefores of this movie without giving the game away and while i have checked the box marked contains spoilers i will not go any further with the plot or the contents lets just say its another stellar performance from washington with brilliant support slick camera work and an excellent plot one which woodward himself would have been proud of,-0.8356,0

DOESNT GET A TEN COS ITS NOT MAN ON FIRE,jetskiboybze,14 May 2019,9,just reviewed so thought it was time to revisit this is an outstanding trip out by denzel marton chloe and melissa with more than adequate support from the filler bad guys loved the side bars to keep the equalization trundling along this film in my opinion is so good i even watch on commercial full channels along with monf which is not normally true unless a film beats my fairly high bar for excellence this one beats the bar by some height the scene between teddy and robert in the restaurant was truly epic in its perfection so kudos to denxel and marton for nailing it only minor niggles were the small plot holes and roberts use of anything but a firearm for maximum death causing lets be honest given his former trade i am sure he is more than proficient in stuff that goes bang at the pointy end having said that maybe it added to the overall deadliness of our main man and perhaps jws pencils could be added to the mix lol in summary far better than but hopefully equal to or even subservient to a prayed for as usual well played mr fuqua you excel in this genre plus a good score that matched the films pace and ambience,0.9915,1
Good story and just for Densel's performance the movie gets the best ratings,rohitreviews,16 January 2019,8,this whole movie is all about densels performance on each frame story is definitely great i wished the villain had more story of the past rather than narrated could have helped for the part overall fun movie,0.7579,1
Dread...,tecnogaming,23 December 2014,4,denzel washington a nice job a kind man and a predicament when he sees how some gang leader hit a nice prostitute some nice dialog and a good start thats about the kindest thing i could say about the movie after the first minutes the whole premise went downhill this has to be the worst action movie in a long time there is absolutely no tension whatsoever when you see a seemingly indestructible guy because hollywood says so that is able to take down and destroy pretty much everyone in his path this is pure hollywood american propaganda where the latinos are weak the americans are super powerful and russians are just gangs and psychopaths total and absolute waste of time with excessive violence and really uncalled for denzel i like your inspirational talks but you gotta stop doing this unnecessary violent movies not recommended for anyone,-0.7766,0
You liked Man On Fire? You'll love Equalizer. Its Boston and the Russian Mob......,febru3012,7 January 2015,9,not mexico and the cartel but its one of denzels best acting performances and shows why he can and does command a minimum of per picture with the equalizer hes a producer so may have settled for less salary regardless this film spends time introducing and defining the characters which i think is a plus and it establishes a trust the viewer has in robert denzels character that allows us to feel comfortable with some very uncomfortable violence he bestows on the russian mob in boston and the crooked cops working with the mob btw i feel certain many people were turned off by the violence and thus gave this film a low rating all i can say about that is the picture reflects reality so if you want to continue to live in a fantasy world go and see disneys frozen also if you want to see another bronson remember the death wish days type movie starring denzel by all means rent or purchase man on fire its denzel vs the mexican drug cartels over a kidnapped little girl its a very good movie see the equalizer and man on fire for a terrific double feature evening,0.2158,1
Nice Revenge Movie,aheaven2005,6 November 2021,8,revenge movies are omnipresent in the cinematic world right now and the equalizer is a good example of how they work when well executed denzel washington is really solid as the lead on this one and what a nice thing to see pullman in there,0.6478,1
"The coolest ""One Man Army"" guy out there. Denzel Washington is the best one.",xxxxxdarkmoon,24 July 2023,10,there are many oneman armies jason stratham keanu reeves liam neeson and a lot more and in my personal top are liam neeson in taken in the place mary elizabeth winstead in kate in the place but the absolute no and most believable is denzel washington in the equalizer plus the sequel storywise the sequel is even better the fight scenes are unmatched in both parts denzel plays a silent killer and he always gives his opponents a chance to stop what they are doing with one exception which is those young dudes who filmed the raping of an intoxicated girl the equalizer movies are masterfully done and the good news is a one is on the way i cant wait for it,-0.9001,0
Awesome,quinn-cunniff,26 July 2015,8,the equalizer a change of pace film that was sorely needed this film is denzel washington in his quest to reenact the last scene if skyfall i really enjoyed this film and although it isnt anything amazing it knows what it is i think the part of this film that summarizes it is when the denzel washington character blows up a boat and it is no joke a minute and a half of just replaying the explosion from different angles everything that happens is drawn out to a point of amazement and accompanied by the fact that the crowd in the theatre cheered with me whenever he got a kill this movie is just a really fun time although i think john wick which we will discuss in a minute is superior the equalizer is still great an great if you guys want more in depth reviews please be sure to check me out quinn c with the james bond emblem on youtube i do daily videos reviewing films of old and new and also give very in depth analysis of the james bond films so if you enjoyed andor appreciated this review please be sure to check me out at quinn c on youtube with the james bond emblem thanks,0.9884,1
Starts with good character work but moves into spoof territory,IndustriousAngel,26 November 2016,5,the equalizer starts out ok there was some good character work and i thought the rapport between equalizer bob workinghiding in a diy market young prostitute teri and also bobs coworker ralphie was good sadly after about of relaxed storytelling the movie switches genres and the vigilante plot what plot he just finishes them off one by one was neither captivating nor logical and it even managed to lack tension the worst thing was that is was so hilarious we saw this as a double feature with deathgasm which was maybe unlucky for the equalizer but once the killings moved to the diy store we couldnt help but giggle laugh and finally roll on the floor and that is probably not what they had in mind when making the equalizer one more case of a movie that has certain strengths in this case the character work but doesnt realise it and accordingly loses its path along the way,-0.4384,0
Denzel Washington back at it with a touch of OCD,alexbelenky14,16 December 2014,8,this movie is based on the premise of the s tv series of the same name this movie and reboot to the series isnt exactly the nonstop action thriller most are expecting but non the less its moody violent has good character development and a not so formulaic plot the director fuqua does a good job in projecting a visually dark world a sort of shadowy noir underworld also robert mccall denzel adds a touch of ocd to his character which plays a very unique role in the movie conclusion it feels like a action movie throwback done with the proper brutal violence bloodshed slow motion sequences and good acting its a very unique movie grade if possible,-0.5554,0
Not bored once,carolajayisavon,19 July 2020,9,good movie good story cinematography loads of action the only thing id say wrong with it is not much dialogue otherwise would have given it looked forward to watching the equalizer and have now watched it,0.4019,1

"Realism, Violence, Intelligence, Perfect Action Movie for all intents and purposes.",ericzillazillo,19 January 2015,9,when watching action movies i always wonder if its even possible to have a film where the hero doesnt make mistakes and still have it be a entertaining film with suspense because in too many action movies the hero will slip up in a ridiculous way so the story can lead to the inevitable standoff but that doesnt happen here in the equalizer denzel washington is an exassassin turned bourne again assassin who does it right hes an ordinary human being with superhuman skills unleashing violence when persuasion fails to move the bad guys the fight scenes are really cool you have the thing where the situation is surveyed in slow motion and then the fighter leaps into action i always like it when films show this process the movie makes you feel intelligent for watching people get brutally murdered because robert mccall is a oneman wrecking machine and he must use his wits to turn the tide against the numerous enemies he may seem impervious at times but in no way does his continued survival feel forced there are a few minor quips i have about the movie though theres some ridiculously obvious metaphors early on in the exposition about hope etc that rather annoyed me because its obvious the writers were trying to compare the character dialog to the impending storyline i praise denzel washingtons character but his success wasnt completely possible without the villains being at least slightly stupid simply the villains make mistakes oh well you cant have everything overall though with its intelligent yet intense and satisfying violence a rarity of a perfect hero and simply overall entertainment the equalizer is perhaps the best action film of and youd be doing yourself a disservice to miss it,0.9437,1
no meaning at all,bisttra,30 December 2014,5,i can not understand what is the meaning of this more than two hour film that there are some ex fbi guys who if got angry could destroy all alone the russian mobsters all over the globe even in moscow no meter they are like a crow among pigeons but they dont got angry still i dont just like denzel washington i love him why at the first half hour i thought wait this is denzel after all wait and you will see the hidden masterpiece this is not even a good action movie are the authors trying to create the new super hero the supermarket man with hammer and drill who calmly kills the bad guys hes got mysterious abilities that we do not see or even been hinted for he just travels the local bus and protects people he likes he says he do not knows why just trying to reach justice and peace i see it is based over a comics maybe some do not need to be filmed,0.984,1
Equalizer has no chill,gonzmon,25 May 2024,10,im giving this movie many stars because i love justice after hearing how fantastic this is so many times i finally got around to seeing it in this film denzel is outstanding and demonstrates his fierce side this movie is great if you want to watch a pure action thriller its the ideal movie for a hangover on a saturday night this is not the movie you should see if youre seeking nirvana or enlightenment this is a film about an eye for an eye kicking your butt two hour lenght you are captivated from the first scene to the very end and its never too late to appreciate a great thriller i find it somewhat puzzling that some critics are more concerned with insignificant story points and arent enjoying the action as it is happening,0.9834,1
Spectacular action movie with a lot of heart,mfeierskov,6 July 2024,8,this movie is really a cut above the rest of the action movies out there the entire opening of the movie is so well acted and perfectly sets up denzels character who continues to be fleshed out in the sequels obviously they have to cut a few corners in the fight scenes because denzel is no spring chicken anymore but it doesnt really hurt the movie as action movies there are of course better things out there and purely on action it doesnt stand out against things like john wick or the raid but the story of denzels character and the struggle he goes through is what sets it apart he continues to be my favorite actor,0.9156,1
"DEI, but with good result",rebecca_campbell_davila,8 February 2024,8,the only thing saving this first installment of a bad race swap of a story is the great actor denzel washington perhaps it was meant just as an introduction but even then the excessive violence is so absurd worse is the excuse the main character gives i gave him a choice the only choice is his nobody elses but writer and director dont get this basic ethic and moral virtue so they made their so called hero a monster in virtue csokas gives a similar quality performance but as washingtons his teddy is even more flawed a sociopath which is not a good villain quality material heroes are made by the situations the villains create as such robert is as much flawed as teddy nothing more about the story the movie itself worth something just the mechanic and flow of the dynamics of the situation for that mr fuqua exhibits great competence but i am afraid he could have done a better job,0.9614,1

The best thing in the movie is Joy Division song that plays at the final scene,kaankavusan-118-22415,27 September 2014,5,first of all this is a very average action movie if youre looking something new look an another way because denzel washington and antoine fuquas reunion is only commercial purposes only why i am saying the movie is average denzel plays a obsessive badass his obsesses are timing and justice so he is a macho icon as you know im not bad with macho icons but denzel only fooling around to kick some ass story is so simple if youre doing a action movie and your only trick is carisma of your star actor then story matters we watched every thing about equializers and fuqua is not so much good at story telling remember tears of the sun the best thing in the movie is the joy division song that plays at the final scene,0.3934,1
Psychopath or Vigilante,owensheekey,26 June 2024,8,this thriller film drew my attention for its entire duration the main character is a sociopathic killer however he is akin to dexter in the film series by the same name he is cold with no emotions he only acts by thoughts devoid of feeling however his psychopathic killing is directed only towards those who are evil otherwise he acts with compassion and helpfulness towards good people albeit with no feeling positive or negative just neutral the question then arises is he an evil psychopath or is he a vigilante who only kills other psychopaths this is a fictional movie not based on reality,-0.946,0
Mix between action and drama,martin_merelesc,14 October 2023,9,how the equalizer became one of the greatest modern action sagas should surprise no one the film by investigating the dual morality of the main character turns this film into a crossroads of what is or how to reach the most positive conclusion for the greatest number of people the plot from the first minute focuses on exploring the personality of robert an apparently positive man with the moral action of helping whoever is in front of him but with a disconnection from the world in which he currently lives not really feeling like he belongs nowhere neither with his coworkers nor with himself being more a remembrance of what he was more of who he is today having an apparent connection with teri both seem to get along so well because of the limbo in which his life finds himself they are so different but with the same uncertainty about their lives they are aware that they are not happy where they are currently but they know that they cannot get out of there it is the most they can aspire to while teri faces it in a more gray robert sees it as the possibility of having a connection with a group of people since without that work he would have no purpose being a reminder for me of how threedimensional people are not being a cliché in their profession or in their actions with others each person has a double face that they do not expose to everyone something that i really liked about this film is how they do not glorify violence it is more the driver of such an extremist resolution to which they have pushed the character since robert moves and justifies himself in using said violence for a greater good that directly affects other people and not only himself teris apparent kidnapping by the russian mafia is what forces him to come out of retirement and return to being a vigilante having an amoral dilemma in his actions not being governed by the actions he does but by the results achieved not acting violently for himself but to help others which in a certain way for me makes him a modern robin hood having a clemency to whom he faces since in his construction he always provides a second option before dispensing justice either with the police that makes them choose to return the money to those who had been asking for a bribe or with frank to who gives him the option to turn himself in even if it ruins his career as a police officer the confrontation between him and the russian mafia being the only way to regain his personal freedom since they interfered with roberts close circle this film being more than a story of revenge the message how i perceive it is that having a group of people around you makes you get up every day since a person without anyone around him will hardly have motivations in his life whether in the first act when robert helps ralphie become a security guard or in the third act when he has to risk everything to save his companions from his personal feud with the mafia closing this subdialogue is how ralphie returns to help robert even if it is an apparently suicidal mission supporting and helping others almost never goes unnoticed,0.9836,1
Bad guy's horror (may contain some spoilers),urmas-kungla,16 December 2014,8,this movie begins like an average hollywood bad past new beginning lost to new bad and at first seems like an average one guy movie what it really was for me was a movie that pulled me off from my everyday average simple jet lucky and easy life reminded me of some of the real world out there and then put one guy in the middle of it and that again reminded me that it was a movie by heart really a good guy judge buy action then not that good i guess i mean it wasnt simple shoot and kill movie if you would see the movie from the bad guys perspective it would rather be a horror movie they way it all went down anyhow certainly a worth watch although at times it was a bit over pushed the way that one guy brings all the horror on all the bad guys dont watch if you cant stand bloody horror movies,-0.8826,0
Love Denzel in this!,kelli3222,10 January 2015,10,love denzel in just about everything this did not disappoint the movie may start out a bit slow but stay with it you will not regret it this is one of the greatest action flicks ive seen in a while denzel is fighting for something and when hes playing a character that does that i think it just makes him sexier showing throughout that he does care for the few people in his life hes very mysterious throughout the movie and the audience is left trying to figure out what exactly is in his past this was certainly a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is coming next i hope they made a sequel to this ill be in line,0.9575,1
Watch it and learn,digdog-785-717538,12 December 2014,5,generally speaking denzel washington tends to be excellent in everything he is ever in so maybe the equalizer has him being excellent but you would have a hard time placing his acting coherently in this oversimplified excruciatingly phonedin script with repetitive stock characters you see a good director will use the actors expressions to punctuate important sections of the script but the script in this film is so dull so lifeless and predictable the main entertainment comes with finding out how accurately you the audience can predict what will happen wordforword rather than being left in wide gaping amazement at the twists in the story spoilers ahead denzel whatsisname is a cia man he is the most brutal death personified cia man who is living a quiet life without explanation because who needs plot he takes under his wing a random prostitute because who needs character development he then proceeds to butcher a ton of russian mafia guys through the cliché you think the bad guys are badass but our hero is so much badasser with a healthy escalation of badassery throughout the end the equalizer is a perfect example of how to not make a film this is by far the most obvious blatant predictable unspoilable film i have ever seen sure denzel is a pleasure to watch and i am sure his performance could have been used to great effect if cut out and placed in a proper film but as it stands now i cannot give this film anything more than my final vote watch it and learn what to avoid in filmmaking,0.9033,1
They got this one extremely right.,nadavsuissa,20 December 2014,10,wow just wow what else can i say well to begin i have to say that dezel hit this one right out of the park with his stellar performance and extremely well written out character the movie starts out very simple a black waking up every morning going to his simple job and and the end of everyday going to his favorite dinner to drink coffee and read a book seems normal right well the twists comes when he starts getting attached to a young female prostitute that eventually get in very big trouble with the russian mafiamcoll who feels sorry for her decides to go and intervene he goes to her boss and asks to buy her from them for of course they laugh at him and send him away without the girl from this point you can say that the movie begins mcoll gets angry and through the movie you get to see and very well motivated denzel washington playing at his best to sum this one up i really do think that they nailed the movie with great acting from everyone side and a great plot that brought out the good and old denzel that all grew to lovei highly recommend for everyone to see this movies and enjoy it just the was that i did,0.9908,1

It's only a movie!,michel-43922,7 April 2017,10,the equalizer is certainly not an original movies like the matrix or bourne supremacy come up from time to time to make our head spin the rest of the time you get junk the equalizer is somewhere in between solely because danzel washington plays an interesting character very well the rest of the cast is also excellent the direction and photography makes it enjoyable to watch it seems to me that many viewers are addicted to fast pace movies if its a bit slow starting they tune off i dont mind personally not every action movie has to be fast and furious there are people who like fast pace and others who enjoy some thinking time or are simply waiting for a break in the action to go to the bathroom your wife or girlfriend wont likely appreciate the violence but in this kind of action movies you expect the baddies to act evil i found the equalizer enjoyable love the atmosphere and waited patiently to see the bad guys get wasted its always a satisfying feeling short of ever seeing that kind of outcome in the real world were bound to see many more of these movies good and bad in the future,0.4743,1
First of trilogy,ryanmo-35178,11 October 2023,8,just watched the final one in cinema and could not wait to rewatch this one again denzel was much younger in this movie and thus more convincing in the fighting scene the attitude is just the same help the one needed even its a passerby and i could not remember chloe is the victim the fighting scenes in the club is good count down to seconds is just a wow and the using of different applies to fight in the supermarket is just so fun and he can help his fat colleagues just shows how good he is anyway i still not sure why he is just so strong and powerful and would it be dislocated in the second episode,0.9632,1

"Super bloody and violent, but still enjoyable!",joshuadrake-91275,23 September 2015,9,the equalizer is a movie that i wanted to see because it was a movie that i wanted see because denzel washington was playing him and the director of training day antoine fuqua was directing it and the film was based on the s television series of the same name the film follows robert mccall and he is a retired black ops government operative who lives in boston massachusetts and works at a home mart hardware store where he befriends many of his coworkers and also tries to help a security guard trainee ralphie pass his qualification exam he has promised his deceased wife that he would leave his old life behind but is compelled to act after his teenage friend teri whose real name is alina was seen being mistreated by her pimp slavi and this leads into him seeking on the russian mafia he then identifies himself as the equalizer the film is a dream come true for me when this came out my mom got this movie for me on bootleg along with guardians of the galaxy while my sister daquantria got me captain america the winter soldier and i liked both of those but i also really like this film and it was so damn good the plot is really amazing and it does not take me that many times for me to understand and the script writer of this film richard wenk did a really great job and it was spectacular and amazing to see and hear the dialogue was really amazing and so damn spectacular the one major thing that bothers me and this is the reason why this movie appears on my top overrated movies list on imdb on my profile is because some of the action scenes can get a lot bloody and violent in a few areas i dont mind blood at all but its just that they use way too much blood in some of the action sequences in the equalizer the performances in this film as phenomenal in this film academy award winner denzel washington is known for his superbad villain role in the film training day which he won the oscar for best actor for his portrayal and that film is just beautiful and amazing and it is really cool to see him as a good guy fighting against the russians once again after what the russians did to him at the end of training day chloe grace moretz plays arina teri and she does a great job after i watched her in carrie and in dark shadows and she does two hell of a performances in those films and shes really nice here melissa leo despite my mixed feelings towards her in prisoners i like her in this film her performance is incredible bill pullman is in this film and does a really great job martin csokas plays teddy and he does a great job too despite the amount of screen time that he has in the film he does really great the production values are amazing especially the music and action sequences but like i said the action sequences are way too bloody gory and violent and i think it does not hurt my viewing experience this is an rrated film so if you did not like blood and violence dont watch it for all you sensitive kids but for all you people who likes blood and violence in action movies or scary movies or sciencefiction or zombie movies the equalizer is definitely worth a watch i give this movie a out of stars and the film is just really amazing and i have no problem watching this again and again the film is just really amazing and denzel washingtons performance is the best of his long time career and i encourage you to watch the film you might get something out of it,0.999,1

Small Screen action on the Big Screen,poe426,12 January 2015,5,we all make mistakes one of my greatest failings if you ask me that is is that i often rent or pay to see a movie without doublechecking the credits i sat through the equalizer because i think denzel washington is one of the finest actors of his generation and because id often enjoyed the teleseries upon which this movie was based it gets off to a slow start with scenes as predictable and just about as compelling as say the opening scenes of an episode of an old television series and it doesnt really make any forward progress its been quite some time since i saw an episode of the old teleshow so im not going to say ones better than the other but i will say that i expected a lot more from this movie than it delivers washington is wasted here the equalizer is standard action fare of the televariety nothing more,-0.2156,0

Man on Fire + Eastern Promises = The Equalizer,girlswithafros,1 November 2014,8,dont get me wrong i loved man on fire and eastern promises they are two of my favorites but are there really no new ideas in hollywood this film is a formulaic rehash of two ten year old action movies denzel does an excellent job of beating up bad guys for a sixty year old man that is but fo reals can even a ciatrained killer really hold his own against fsbtrained killers half his age denzel was falling apart in man on fire and that was ten years ago im not saying that this film is bad because it isnt there is a surprising amount of character development for a movie of this genre but in my opinion it stretches the believability factor due to denzels age its like a something sean connery bangin twentysomething hotties in the bond films wait a minute,-0.9759,0
A Denzel Washington flick,sauravjoshi85,12 October 2019,8,the equalizer is an action thriller movie starring denzel washington marton csokas chloë grace mortez david harbour and johnny skourtis and is directed by antoine fuqua the movie is based on the tv series on the same name the movie might not be that profound but it is a very well planned action thriller the killing by guns knives corkscrew barbed wire and drill is not only brutal but also shows the true character the character of washington is appealing in the form of ruthless fighters so as of csokas who is equally ruthless and smart the fighting scenes is amazing background music is also good the only little flaw in the movie is its slow climax overall a convincing action movie and if you are an action lover this is a movie for you,0.9791,1
A Middle of the Road Action-Thriller,freemantle_uk,1 August 2021,5,based on a tv series from the the equalizer was a gritty style revenge thriller what was delivered was a film that could be described as dad cinema the plot was a mashup of taxi driver and john wick because it follows a loner with a certain set of skills taking on the russian mafia to save a teenage prostitute the equalizer was a film that treated its plot very seriously and it was a really violent film the finale takes place in a hardware store and it was fun to see all tools being used as weapons however the equalizer was directed by antoine fuqua whos a workmanlike director he can get the job done but he doesnt offer much style or flash nor didnt it help that the equalizer got distracted by its subplots as it stretches out its runtime,-0.5569,0
Denzel's VERY BEST! in years!,Deb2theC,9 June 2015,9,i didnt know for sure until i saw the list of credits listed herein but i definitely had a feeling that antoine fuqua had something to do wthis film and that feeling went on to be justified unlike training day an entirely moral man was to be portrayeda man who believes in the rights of the little guy and that right should conquer over evil which mccall goes on to do i loved this film and loved the role that denzel plays in it denzel almost always has chosen to portray great characters in film sometimes evil more often moral but always interesting and this film does that with a capital i my only complaint is that i wish something would have been shown a little bit earlier about what happened to alina since her survival was really what mccall was fighting for from the very beginning but i am by nature a bit of a nitpickeronly real complaint though,0.941,1
Washington Makes the Movie Based on the TV Show Of the Same Name!,shelbythuylinh,29 November 2021,8,as he plays mild mannered operative and special forces soldier robert mccall working at a home depot like store and that he tries to stay under the radar in faking his death then young haley bennett who comes to his aide says she has no choice but to be a prostitute for russian mafia and it awakens mccall once again to come out of justice while trying to lay low but that it is easier said than done there,0.7003,1

Wow - unexpectedly awesome!,spradley-3,22 October 2016,10,i like denzel but never thought of him as a jason bourne type but in this movie hes definitely up there with liam in taken he doesnt just kick butt he really kicks it and he looks them straight in the eye when doing it hes no nonsense no explaining the situation no negotiating the payback in this feels good because the bad guys are so bad well acted too the scenes are done well setting the mood the late night diner scenes are great if youve ever been up in the middle of the night and couldnt sleep and you go out to the local hr cafe this is just what youd picture it would be like you dont get a lot of detail behind denzels character only that hes definitely been through a lot had a wife has ocd his apartment is stark no decorations just the necessities to live no mess everything in its place denzel does this characters incredibly well its a tough one to play theres very little emotion even in very emotional situations great action great power check it out highly recommend,0.9724,1
Excessively violent and unevenly paced - needs a Besson touch,phd_travel,2 August 2015,5,watching this movie makes you wish luc besson had given the makers of this movie some lessons about how to make an action movie director antoine fuqua turns things round with an invincible african american hero dealing with white criminals eg the russian mob and crooked boston irish cops the problems are mainly in the pace and the action sequences the pace is uneven with some draggy staring scenes interspersed by some sudden excessively graphic violence the violence is revolting not funny too much is shown during each killing denzel as the invincible vigilante like ex agent does some fighting and action but its a bit like liam neesons fighting in the last few taken movies a bit suggested with camera work chloe grace moretz as an abused russian prostitute is a scene stealer and shows she can act any kind of role well overall a not quite get your moneys worth flawed action thriller,-0.6191,0
I remember a similar movie with same actor,maxfrimodig,13 February 2015,9,here we see him denzel again is it good of course it is its great i think would i see it again yes i will the plot is good he does read books he is smart and there is a young prostitute that he helps this is a movie where you know you are going to like he is a hard man with a nice attitude a education in hurting and using it do give justice could you ever think that this movie would be another i want to be that guy movie he keep his house clean he got the cash and he is ready to do business first fighting scene is great its just there you know this movie i will see again no question about it,0.9806,1
"A good action movie, thanks to leading actors, above all",BeneCumb,5 January 2015,8,the second cooperation between antoine fuqua and denzel washington has resulted in another pleasant work although not so powerful as training day due to weaker script but still washington is an actor who fills nicely out long individual scenes and parts not directly providing additional value rather than adding tonality and total length after a tardy start and unequal duetto chloë grace moretz as alinateri is sweet but not on a par with washington the events start to roll and washingtonmccall gets a due enemy in the form of teddy well performed by marton czokas other characters are rather vague often played by inexpressive actors or for some reason or another by the actors capable of filling bigger roles melissa leo bill pullman at times the logic of events and venues are odd eg prefinal action in walmart in the form of home alone for adults but fuquawashington round it nicely up without becoming annoying all in all a morethanokay thriller i believe that admirers of washington will not be disappointed,0.9731,1

Even the odds,Prismark10,16 December 2014,5,the equalizer television series was an unlikely hit it featured an old british actor playing a tough guy retired cia operative who rights wrongs and was not afraid to use violence the film has little relation to the television show apart from the title and the character name who is also an ex cia operative denzel washington is actually several years older than edward woodward when he first played the title role antoine fuqua who directed denzel to a best actor oscar teams up with him again the film starts slowly we see mccall working for a home depot type warehouse helping his fellow workers and spending his evening in a diner reading a book however the fate of a russian call girl makes him angry and hell bent on equalizing the score with her gangster pimps their overlord sends a dangerous russian hitman over to find out who is responsible when he crosses mccalls path he knows who was the culprit and sets out to get mccall the film starts off slowly maybe too slowly people forget denzel is not an action star he has made several action films in the past and rather a few have disappointed for every man on fire there is a virtuosity however when denzel gets into action its brutal and bloodsoaked as he uses the tools he has at hand rather handy when he works at a hardware warehouse martin csokas plays a fine gangster lean smart suited and brutal you look forward to his showdown with denzel which also has shades of home alone it is ultimately an ok film nothing outstanding maybe slightly overlong and within a few days easily forgotten,-0.9005,0
The Old Man's Gotta Be The Old Man; The Fish Gotta Be The Fish...,P3n-E-W1s3,19 March 2017,8,this is not the robert mccall i grew up watching and that isnt a bad thing i like the idea that writer richard wenk and director antoine fuqua reenvisioned the s character for the modern era as always denzel washington is superb and brings a new dimension to the character of the equalizer robert mccall is a warehouse worker in a d i y retail store who at work helps his fellow employees though out of work hes a solitary character with a habitual routine that verges on obsessive compulsive disorder each night he goes to the same diner and sits at the same table and orders a cup of water into which he drops a teabag while there he reads a book hes on number of the top books to read before you die he has a conversational relationship with one of the prostitutes that use the diner as a way station this relationship becomes stronger and when she comes in battered and bruised mccall takes it upon himself to help her out from here on in you begin to learn of mccalls secret past as the action and violence amps up mccall is a dark man who keeps his feelings in check though you never get to find out what makes him such a cold and logical executioner this may be because there are more works in the pipeline i hope so as this was an enjoyable movie the only irksome element of the story and movie is the relationship between mccall and the prostitute teri played by chloe grace moretz as i previously stated their relationship takes on an extra vitality however when shes hospitalised he goes to the hospital though never makes contact and this is the last we see of her until the end and this appears to have been an afterthought to give mccall a more humanistic presence i think if the characters had more scenes together throughout the movie this could have help to detract from mccalls cold robotic personality maybe this wasnt the directors vision theres nothing in this film that hasnt been covered in other movies but that doesnt stop this from being an entertaining minutes it kept my attention so well that it really doesnt seem that long a film if you enjoyed the series or like action films or love denzel washington or all three then this film will be right up your street,0.9791,1
Surprisingly good.,missundaztood9,5 August 2018,9,i never really watched the tv series i just saw it here and there so i cant claim any fandom it was mostly a case of watching this as a standalone film the revenge genre is one of my favourite genres and this film is a very worthy addition it actually scared me at times sort of like the godfather did but the direction the script the performances and cinematography are all top notch ive not seen the second one yet but im looking forward to it washington nails it as usual is there anything he cant do,0.1901,1
"Good update and revision of an ""oldie, but goodie""",louisesth,11 January 2015,9,i enjoyed the old television equalizer program and i feel that this updated revision was exceptional the theme of both the old television program and this movie is of hopefulness it is a fantasy and it is entertaining unfortunately the violence portrayed is just a representation of what happens to some people in real life just like the suffering and struggling that is represented this is the world in which some people live that there are parts that could be realistic only makes the story suspenseful i am not into analyzing the plot or character development i am not looking for realism when watching movies or programs of this type this is not a documentary it could be escapism for some from a difficult life that is what i enjoyed from the television series the bad guys got their come uppance i am just glad that sometimes that for the good decent ordinary people there is a hero or superman to save the day i have been a fan of mr washingtons since his early television days to witness and experience his transformation from television actor to his growth of a superstar is impressive,0.9442,1
"This IS Denzel's ""BadAss"" Character",toonarly,3 November 2023,10,denzel is awesome in anything he does hes a great man and a great person as well he does so much good in this fallen world to help others and he speaks out against the stupidity all around us in an intelligent and concise way his acting is superb in this first outing as his new character the equalizer we have denzel at his badass best as a conscientious but very meticulous genius of a type of vigilante but not hes gives all his victims a chance to do the right thing but of course due to the pride of most evil people they dont and they face the consequences of their own actions on this first outing he saves a young russian girl from the russian mob in various ways while also dealing out justice for a few innocent victims its too bad we dont have a real person like this great plot action and a bit violent and gory not for the squeamish or small kids cant wait for number two this franchise will last like mission impossible if they dont screw things up in the sequelsno nudity or questionable content,0.9102,1
No good,greghunt-27605,10 August 2018,1,sorry but only edward woodward or at least someone who resembles him can play the equalizer denzel washington doesnt by a long shot,0.4497,1
An amazing thriller film,guardo,28 June 2018,9,the equalizer is an action movie directed by antoine fuqua where denzel washington is the leading actor in this film denzel plays mccall a man who is retired cia operative and now he works at a hardware store he belives that he has put his mysterious past behind him and now he can live a quiet life in boston massachusetts but during his last nights reading a book in a restaurant he meet teri a teenager prostitute under the control of russian mafia he cant stand the situation suffered by the girl and decide to help her therefore the equalizer is a great film to someone that like a good action because it is full of this in addition the film talk about the traffic of women where the women need to work such as prostitute in another country and suffer in hands of bad men so besides the good actions the film makes a criticism about this problem faced in our society,-0.1406,0
Denzel's a Bad-ass till the end!!,rishavraj181091,14 December 2014,9,if you are looking for a good action movie with thrills and want to be awestruck by the genius fight scenes and bournestyle traps then you have got to watch this moviewith lots of old actors doing an action movie like taken by liam neeson gunmen by sean penn to be released in john wick by keanu reeves etc this movie certainly takes the action genre to a new par and hats off to denzel for performing it so wonderfully not only does he seeks vengeance but mix it with some good rock songs and slow motion in one or two scenes and you got yourself a movie that will give you exhilarating experience that will last through out the till the end i will conclude here by saying that this movie is similar to the joy divisions song new dawn fades a change of speed a change of styles a change of scene with no regrets,0.9331,1

Equal to other movies of this genre.,santiagocosme,18 December 2014,5,equalizer is your typical story of a retired agent who is hiding from his past and now leads a quiet life working in some petty job away from all the action as you always get in this sort of movies no one suspects who he really iswas he keeps to himself he is methodical he leaves alone and his wife broke his heart i bet you have heard this plot before anyway some day as he spends yet another night at a bar reading books he befriends a young girl called alina who works as a hooker and seems to be abused by her pimp he decides to take care of business like in the good old days and kills four guys with a style reminiscent of jason bourne or james bond at his best i consider denzel washington a fantastic actor one of the best but personally i feel he is starting to look a little old for this type of action roles can you imagine the rest i bet you can those four guys he just killed belong to a huge russian mafia clan no evil character cannot speak without a funny accent and they are on their way to the us to get rid of our hero and what does an action hero do in these cases you probably know because its just like another million movies you have seen before he takes them on on his own i guess you get my point the movie doesnt feel like anything new however its still executed well enough to be enjoyable and denzel washington is great so if you feel like watching a movie before going to bed why not theres a lot worse out there,0.9783,1
a nice action drama,Cinema2kMendoza,16 September 2021,10,denzel hardly made a bad movie and this one is really good he does justice when he can and the movie even shows that he was a ex vet with many skills that only used them when he see someone in needonly for action fans and denzel washington fansone of the best action movies ever made,0.8211,1

A Nice Classic Straight-Up Action Film!,t-d-t-m82,9 May 2024,8,the narrative is strong the characaterdevelopment is excellent it has a great feeling of vengeance and empathy and compassion and vile hatred and mixes those feelings in a toxic blender of violent oppression all for robert mccall to use with his quest to take down the russian mob im not entirely sure how they got this far with this much exploitation but it is a good basis for a storyline for a movie the use of girls and trafficking is heatful and emotional and it sets a big trigger in mccalls mindset to go back to his roots and destroy the mob onceandforall and any corruption entangled with it for that just enjoy the ride the sequences are polished and welldone and not overused cgi it does get a bit repetitive as a concept but thats to be expected it has an excellent score there is characterbuilding subplots going on and i think that really does a benefit to understand his motive i really enjoyed this movie and if you dont take it too seriously i think you will too its very well shot and excecuted with great techincal skill by the director its very nearly a masterpiece but not quite cool movie,0.9852,1
Denzel is better than the trama itself,getuliohf,1 February 2021,8,denzel is great even making a movie with poor and repeated story it proves how a charismatic actor like him is important to save the show the sequences are quite predictable and somehow boring in some aspects this story shows how russian girls are slaved by prostitution mafia its hard to accept situations like this why authorities dont go against it money and corruption of course,0.872,1

"Brutally violent, yet still atmospheric",Sandcooler,9 February 2015,9,the revenge flick is one of those subgenres hollywood never seems to get tired of the main reason for that is that they just look so damn easy to write just get a gang of evil stereotypes harming someone innocent and then turn the tables youre done it seems like the formula really does everything for you it just comes down to coming up with action scenes until you can finally kill of the main villain the equalizer however is a movie that shows us how much you can do with the genre if your screenwriters not phoning it in for example most revenge movies make the error of barely establishing the victim making it difficult to care when the baddies get their comeuppance in this one chloe grace moretz doesnt get much screen time but its not necessary it just takes about two scenes to start caring about her character in fact everything about this movie seems compact yet efficient there isnt a single scene that goes on for too long nor is there a single boring moment while most action movies just throw everything they have at you and see what sticks the equalizer is just a perfect puzzle the pacing the visual style the almost cartoonish violence the brilliant performance by denzel washington who switches back and forth between loving friend and cruel angel of vengeance with baffling ease everything just clicks together the equalizer is nothing you havent seen before but youve rarely seen it done this competently,0.8197,1
decent,mattkratz,12 December 2015,8,i never watched the tv series but based on what i read about it this is a nottoobad movie version of it denzel washington is wellcast in the lead as a man with a mysterious past and a drive to help people in needand he meets one in a hooker in trouble with russian hit men he pulls out all the violent stops to help her as she gets beaten up in the process chloe grace moretz is good as the hooker who tries to better herself this is not for the squeamish due to all the persistent violence but i like the good substories and the leads get it if you are a denzel fan who isnt the acting and shooting cameras and guns are all good out of,0.9052,1

Ultra violent spy/executioner mixed bag with racial overtones,adrianovasconcelos,2 November 2021,1,african american director antoine fuqua directs fellow african american denzel washington in a film where he is the only black person and what godly powers he has as a singularly trained former serviceman serving death blowing up places and meting out justice and punishment to an ensemble of white persons who are all villains to make it more palatable for us audiences the top villain is russian that long standing enemy anyway the nemesis does not stand a chance against super agent washington who keeps wringing white necks with considerable relish acting hardly comes into it dw just puts on a menacing glint in his fixed ebonyeyed stare throughout csokas has an interesting start to his role making it clear who is the boss and what he will do to enforce his power but the moment he decides dw has to be caught alive he starts sliding and flushing down the tubes of dws law of talion the resulting mess is a fuming mixed mound of mindless violence that i will make sure never to watch again this film does not just insult ones intelligence it actually reduces it,-0.8058,0
You gotta be who you are in this world !,Zulfmanauthor,28 December 2014,8,denzel washington delivers a grand performance which has to be described as epic in this vigilante thriller about a mysterious man who reveals a brutal and lethal side when faced with violent gangsters the film purely as a film is not great but there is one thing that is undeniably the difference and that is the lead actor chloe grace moretz is good also and her on screen chemistry with denzel is one of the highlights in the film many films owe their star actors much of the credit and this is one of those movies which is fast paced and entertaining with an extra dimension the excia assassin robert mccall works in a hardware store and is faced with decisions to make as to who he really is this insight into mccall makes this whole journey fascinating and the best part is that the audience dont know that much about mccalls past even by the end this is a bad ass movie old fashioned and relentless maybe weve seen it all before but not the way denzel does it,0.9837,1
A Real Action Thriller [8/10],panagiotis1993,5 February 2024,8,my live reaction review for the equalizer this movie has good reviews lets see if it is actually good i expect thrills and lots of action i really hope that this dude will become a security guard so he meets this young prostitute interesting she seems like a very sweet person it sucks that she has to be a worker they gave her a brutal beating time for revenge i like it does bob really think that he can buy her freedom no way well he tried the peaceful way now its time for war some really sweet fight scenes already bob can fight im glad this guy will become a security guard now bob goes against corrupt cops this keeps getting more interesting hour in and the movie is amazing so far a lets see if the second half is good too time for the final showdown its sad that we dont see teri again i hope she will appear before the movie ends many cool fight scenes nice to see teri again at the end of the movie nice to see that teri is not a prostitute anymore the second half of the movie is not as good as the first but still a great movie full of thrills action and good performances my rating is,0.9835,1
The Vigilante Versus the Russian Mob,Uriah43,29 March 2015,8,robert mccall denzel washington is a mildmannered clerk who works at a home improvement store during the day and frequents a quiet diner to read a book at night although they are not friends he sometimes talks to a young prostitute named alina chloe grace moretz who takes a casual interest in some of the books he reads one night he notices that she has a black eye and decides to walk with her a little bit and provide her whatever advice he can offer suddenly a car comes out of nowhere and two men get out and order her to get inside since she refuses roberts help he watches as she gets in the car and the men drive off a day or two later he is told that she is in the intensive care unit where she is recovering from a severe beating he then decides to visit the establishment where the two men work and its at this point that things become really interesting now although this movie apparently suffers from mixed reviews i personally thought that it was rather good i especially liked the vigilante versus the russian mob storyline and the excellent performance of denzel washington in any case although some scenes were clearly a bit unrealistic i still enjoyed this movie and i have rated it accordingly,0.9717,1
"Washington at his best. Tough, ruthless and super cool.",peterp-450-298716,4 January 2015,8,when you pray for rain you gotta deal with the mud too can you remember denzel washingtons performance in the book of eli his coolness and calmness the grimness the power he has to move mountains approaching his target confidently his inner tranquility taking over and with extreme precision dealing with his opponents shrewdly assimilating the situation let it sink in for a moment and than act fast accurately masterfully breathtaking to watch and immensely exciting he also demonstrates these qualities in the equalizer the only difference is that hes not completely blind here at first sight robert mccall denzel washington looks like an ordinary wellorganized man who has an normal job in a hardware store apparently he was one of the pips performing with gladys knight in the distant past according to the plausible explanation of robert who as a bonus demonstrates a few sultry dance moves as illustration the fact he has nothing to do with the pips quickly becomes obvious his true identity is not explained completely in detail its evident he had a career as a sort of special task force member which he turned his back on and now runs a meticulously organized and strictly simple life a sober furnished room with precisely folded bed sheets a sink that looks spick and span and a daily routine going to a coffee shop with a tea bag tucked in his shirt after a consumed supper and a book in his possession which he puts on the table on the same exact place every time he himself is a walking wikipedia who comes up with an appropriate philosophical quote from time to time so its a militaristic ordered life but he also has skills to deal with injustices its as if he gives the criminals of this world who placed themselves above the ordinary people and act as untouchable individuals who manipulate defenseless civilians a taste of their own medicine and knock them off their pedestals a kind of liquidator similarly when the face of teri chloë grace moretz a young hooker robert met in the coffee shop is being remodeled by her pimp slavi david meunier pimped as it were after which she ends up in the hospital when robert wants to straighten out the situation by offering slavi a substantial sum of money which the russian of course declines we finally get what we were waiting for after minutes nobullshit action in slow motion with a with precision hitting washington wiping out a complete russian gang in about seconds and apologizing after wards for it a beautiful scene with a true avenging angel playing the starring role the only drawback is that he has liquidated an important part of the russian mafia and of course they are not going to start a cossack dance on the contrary they send teddy marton csokas a violent character without emotion and also with deadly skills he looks after the affairs of a certain vladimir pushkin vladimir kulich a fearsome opponent for mccall with similar qualities that things arent really believable and the same old clichés are used again i take that for granted washington can set himself as a oneman army and dismantle a russian gangster mob as a schwarzenegger whereby theres slow motion footage and rousing music also the usual characteristics of a revenge movie arent eschewed the simple way of getting rid of a rather wellorganized criminal group explosions in the background and of course theres no looking back again members of the mob who are too dumb for words and are all horrible lousy shooters whod miss an african elephant even while aiming at it from a meter away and the wellknown climax in the end with usage of all available attributes you know a cliché you got it and that the russians are back merely has to do with the fact that this is allowed again on an international level as soon as north korea stops rocking the boat whenever their country is used in a movie and starts sending threats to certain countries you can be sure there will be korean casualties again in future action movies washington is the most suitable man for this part just think of the character joyhn creasy in man on fire who leaves a trail of destruction in mexico city while looking for lupita also the same coolness and determination he plays those roles with a certain flair as if they were written specifically for him his famous denzel characteristics he uses in each film the quiet gaze his typical smile and the icy oneliners i must admit im a washington fan his mutation of a cheerful helpful and humorous average citizen into an avenger of the top shelf who exhibits sadistic features is magnificent and despite her young age chloë grace moretz shows a lot of maturity the makeup probably helped with this but still its an excellent interpretation by this young talent the rest of the cast really looks like a bunch of terrifying mobsters with their upper bodies covered by tattoos their corrupt spirit and their stonehard indifference despite the long playtime and the slow storyline i never felt bored this action packed revenge movie was over before i knew it of course the content is a bit shallow and after wards you start wondering why the heck there isnt a global group of such figures as mccall who hunt down organizations worldwide and liquidate them with an arsenal of nail guns you do get the impression that mccall is a kind of super hero with human vulnerability and that its just an intense action movie with some mindless hulks but it was fun and a hell of a rollercoaster ride more reviews here,0.9826,1
Ridiculously Unbelievable Action Flick,cailyn1,10 March 2015,4,i rented this title based solely on denzel washingtons presence hes a great actor and i have loved almost every role hes played from training day to the pelican brief this movie was a turd almost from the beginning the killing of five russian mobsters over a girl he barely knows not saying they might not have deserved it but this disconnect runs through the movie wanton killing without ever developing a believable motivation the ending is so over the top i had to run home and watch the last die hard installment to wash the awfulness of this movie out of my mouth the final killings in russia were sheer crap so ridiculous so over the top i was left wondering how denzel ever agreed to a role in this slag heap is way generous,-0.9131,0
surprisingly good,spartacrust,12 March 2017,8,this was way better than i expected although denzil has made some poor films in his time this was certainly not one of them better than the original tv series with edward woodward although done on a far larger budget i thought it had paul greengrass written all over it until i saw the credits the music score deserves some acknowledgement too i only hope the following episodes are just as gripping,0.8957,1
Loved it. Denzel great!,bazookamouth-221-898097,22 September 2018,8,denzel has done this kind of role before in man on fire he certainly can hold his own in this type of movie his character robert is very likeable the violent set pieces are great to watch and filmed with skill the villain russian leader martin csokas reminded me so much of kevin spacey he was credible certainly better than pascal in the movie but one weak link was the finale in the home improvement store it went on for to long and was predictable also chloe grace moretz goes missing for a large chunk of the movie i felt it would have been better to have her around as she is a quality young actress still denzel is class always watchable great movie,0.9327,1
An Action Star is Reborn,talibmania,17 March 2015,10,i always liked dws movies this is a change in direction for him just like liam neeson became an action superstar late in the day dw has just raised the bar the first half hour seems to be at a very slow pace but with good reason the few characters that are in the movie are very interesting and well played out the bad guy is superb a contender for the baddie of the year award as far as im concerned the action sequences are awesome swift and visceral plenty of blood n guts for those who prefer grown up violence as opposed to edward woodward style ill shoot you in the leg if i really have to which i loved as a kid hence my video taliboss does the equalizer on a certain video website this raised the benchmark for modern intelligent action movies i loved it,0.9897,1
Denzel Washington is the finest piece of Prose you will ever watch,jimelas-835-982916,19 January 2015,10,first and foremost denzel is the finest actor this side of kingdom come he effortlessly excels in this movie as with all of his movies but this one was excellent because we got to see quiet genius behind the brawn we got to see the strongest muscle and that was his brain and that is what sets this movie apart i never watched the tv show so im looking at this movie with an open and fresh perspective this movie gave me everything i needed and it satisfied me to the very end it was complete well written and efficient there was no grandstanding just good old fashioned maneuvering and outwitting your opponent it was like watching a chess match but with a grand master and a novice at the board if you go in without any expectations i believe you will enjoy this movie for what its meant to be and thats just a good time nothing more nothing less fine acting fine directing and well written what more can you ask for,0.9914,1
humdrum,magnuslhad,1 March 2015,5,denzel washington makes this film watchable but even he cant make it soar a former military man works in a home depot but has to fall back on his special skill set in order to help those around him the guy is less good samaritan and closer to goodytwo shoes he wants to launch the singing career of a prostitute and help a tubby colleague slim down to take a test it is all a bit saccharine and twee till an intriguing russian villain shows up carrying real menace from there the film becomes more action oriented but still doesnt outdo the taken or bourne franchises our man goes back to his bosses to ask not for help but permission an especially sleek piece of dialogue the film is tonally inconsistent and seems too obviously an attempt to reboot the tv show denzel is as charismatic as ever but his range is barely tested in this role a decent bmovie action flick but not much more,0.8131,1
A Highly Recommended suspense Action Thriller,mrcibubur,26 December 2014,8,this is not my favourite film of the year but it is certainly one of the most enjoyable in terms of the action thrills and suspense comparisons with matt damon in the jason bourne movies are for me way off the mark i have never watched the equalizer tv series and denzel washingtons acting in this movie must rank as some of the coolest i have seen in a while which makes all the film appealing this film has a gripping story and will you watching until the end no romance in the story unless mccalls association with the girl was considered in some way romantic i didnt i love to hate russians anyway for the way the gangstermanner they are portrayed in the film full of arrogance and disregard for society the story bolts together nicely but the shootout towards the end of the film was the one negative for me rather than the false russian accents throughout as that was not in keeping with the nature of the film it lacked subtlety and mr mccall deserved more respect in bringing terminus to proceedings i would like to see a film on the back story on what led to mr mccalls quiet and secretative life portrayed in the film it would be quite a prequel,0.9444,1
🇹🇷,kadir-25015,10 March 2021,9,veterans all try to get justice themselves because they see that the law is inadequate so its a good movie,0.5965,1
Good entertainment but tooooo long,pintaxandre,10 October 2019,8,hours is really a stretch for a movie with such a simple plot its a good story but the first part drags way too long good action and terrific acting from both denzel washington and chloe grace moretz good directing from antoine fuqua as well it is a good action movie but this one isnt really mesmerizing in a few years i will remember john wick movies way better thats what happens when you have a good film but almost no originality whatsoever i enjoyed it but i also feel a great potential that could have been better exploited,0.9907,1
Perfectly entertaining action thriller you shouldn't miss!!!,circuit87-691-551240,21 December 2014,9,this is what you should expect from an action thriller flick pace thrill action story and denzel washington at his best movie makes you remember the transporter taken parker etc though does not miss originality due to denzel washington he is just awesome first minutes are of peace but then movie keeps you engaged till the end the actions scenes are really goodmusic is good cinematography is very good characters and the acting at their best in my opinion you must enjoy the movie without criticizing because no movie is flawless and you should not miss the fun in finding the flaws thats all watch it for the real entertainment,0.9918,1
not a fantastic film unbelievable abilities of the hero,adelhaki,18 December 2014,5,for me action movie should be a realistic one i am not watching a science fiction movie while the hero has abnormal abilities considering that he is a human being i saw the abilities of denzel washington near those arnold schwarzenegger has in terminator movie and its not fits the differences between pure action film and a one which has in it a science fiction sides also no one can defeat an army specially when we talks about a russian mafia gangs the master exaggerated scene was when denzel break into the mafia boss castle facing no resistance killing him and walk away on peace how ironic specially while denzel left with no wounds the movie has its nice sides of entertaining and it full of action and rapid strikes there was a rush in the end as if the filmmaker note that the film has lasted too long so he decided to end it skipping some action scenes that are necessary to complete the whole image so you can see it if you have enough time and not interested in details,-0.4325,0
full of excitement,atiehhojat,7 April 2024,8,it is a very good movie in its genre everything is perfect and good and correct script direction games filming set and costume design of course there are some violent scenes that can be annoying for those who are sensitive other than these scenes the movie has no other problems mccalls characterization can be found in the archetype of god which is very well characterization in addition there are very good dialogues throughout the film which are thoughtprovoking and informative it has very deep and valuable dialogues which of course are skillfully titled meaning they dont have a sloganlike and omniscient attitude and look up and down,0.8637,1
DDD - Denzel Doesn't Disappoint!,tzachn,12 January 2015,8,anyone who is expecting some groundbreaking genredefining stuff here dont its your standard traditional one man against the world scenario here but denzel manages to turn it around to an emotional partially psychological thriller like no other actor does what you get is a calculated precise tailored fastpaced textbook action flick that is simply well made and satisfies the viewer in almost every way soundtrack and sound effects are bingo and denzels character is wrapped with mystery along with an intelligent and intellectual dialog that manages to surprise even in moments that scream for the well known occasional cliché phrases in summary if youre looking for a good action title that will also challenge your mind a bit in addition to keeping you on the edge of your seats watch the equalizer,0.9744,1

"Denzel is THE MAN. Cool, calm and collected. Violent, but righteous!",imseeg,21 August 2018,8,my fifth viewing and this movie is a rock solid action hero flick the good denzel denzel denzel if anyone can pose as a cool calm and collected tough good guy then it is denzel what performance more good a really obnoxious vicious bad guy whose sole job it is to annihilate denzel what follows is a cat and mouse game that is suspenseful and thrilling and riveting from start till finish even more good all the technical details like the photography editing and sound are eye and ear candy the works perfect craftmanship what a solid action flick hihgly recommended for the fans of the genre it wont get much better than this beware the sequels are pretty subpar and tedious,0.9652,1
c r a p,benjaminn-meme,23 December 2014,1,lol i laughed hard at almost all the reviews with less that stars because theyre basically all true this movie has nothing new in it and is predictable from the start to the finish the worst part was when the hostages were released and no one thought to call like what the hell this movie was so boring i spent three days trying to complete it im so glad im done with it at the beginning of the movie i actually thought bob denzel washington had the ability to pauseslow down time because of the excess slowmo effects if you are a huge fan of action movies i dont think youd enjoy this but give it a try who knows watch three days to kill and youll know what action is,-0.7633,0
Very entertaining vigilante flick,p-jonsson,7 February 2015,8,for me this vas a very entertaining vigilante flick denzel washington is excellent in his role as a cold and calculating yet compassionate vigilante the movie is slower than a lot of movies in this genre but that does not make it boring and when the action starts it is measured for a movie in this genre and well done although there is a red thread started by mccalls first act of vigilantism running through the movie he also performs a few on the side jobs as well during the movie i like the vigilante stuff so for me this was some nice fillers to round off the movie the main thread pitches mccall against a real psychopathic russian enforcer no one can say that this movie did not have a well done bad guy the role is quite well played the guy is creepy to say the least not to mention violent of course but then so is mccall when the time is right one thing i liked with this movie is that mccall it is not one of the usual run around look dangerous and clobber the bad guys in periodic outbursts of violence stereotypes mccall is always calm calculating behaving intelligently and the baddies almost never realizes the mistake they just did until it is quite a bit too late sure the capacity of mccall to clobber the bad guys usually without getting hurt himself is bordering on superhuman but what the heck it is fiction after all totally realistic movies are rarely fun at least not movies of this genre also the end fight where the baddies are more or less running around aimlessly and get taken out could have been better especially since the russian mobster had shown quite a bit of intelligence up until that point having said that i did like that it did not degenerate into the usual minute shoot anything that moves nonsense mccall is continuing his cold and calculating rampage through the unfortunate individuals on the wrong side and the various ways of disposing of them are rather creative on the whole i found this to be a rather entertaining movie in one sense it is the usual vigilante stuff which i happen to like but in one sense it is not your normal run of the mill vigilante movie thanks to denzel washingtons cold calculating and intelligent portrayal of mccall,0.9853,1
Denzel is the boss,singingmysong,17 August 2018,10,denzel washington plays bob or robert when hes reading a mildmannered worker in a boston doityourself megastore but a man with a secretive past needing only it seems about hours sleep a night bob frequents an allnight diner where he befriends prostitute teri played by chloe grace moretz she ends up in the hospital thanks to some pimp heavies and bob exacts bloody justice on the guys unfortunately these are the henchmen of a huge russian mafia operation in the us and bobs fight becomes a fullscale war against the leader pushkin vladamir kulich and his badguyinchief the curiously named teddy played with menacing glee by marton csokas celeborn in this movie is a cut above the normal mafia crime drama story washingtons bob is portrayed as an intelligent thoughtful but deeply wounded man and the audience can empathise with his burning desire to give back to society chloe grace moretz is again outstanding as the equally wounded teri trying desperately to find a way out of the deep pit she finds her life to be in moretz looks set to continue her trajectory to become a hollywood great and csokas as the steely and cold mafia killing machine makes for an extremely menacing villain,0.9476,1

Great action movie with a focus on characters,masonsaul,19 December 2018,8,the equalizer doesnt offer much thats new in its straightforward narrative but it still manages to find a pretty fresh angle thanks to a slow but engaging pace that takes its time before getting to the action and a clear care taken with its characters it remains a great revenge flick denzel washington is perfect here he portrays robert mccall as a gentle giant with a dark past someone whos really good at killing but doesnt enjoy it and its all done with such class and natural confidence walking away from an explosion in slow motion has rarely been this undeniably cool marton csokas is a great villain theres no doubt hes completely over acting in almost every scene but it actually works and hes a solid inversion of mccall someone who appears calm and composed early on but once he becomes violent its an unstoppable all consuming rage he clearly enjoys antoine fuquas direction is excellent especially in the action he understands that sometimes just showing the aftermath is enough and when he does show the violence its brutal quick and methodical the cuts actually enhance and further emphasise mccalls skill and efficiency,0.98,1

"Enjoyable, even if the main character is a little too ""immortal"".",fostersforums,31 January 2021,8,its satisfying seeing bad guys get what they deserve and the equalizer delivers on this premise very well if you like seeing nasty arrogant criminals getting their comeuppance this movie and the sequel is for you the only pitfall is a minor one the protagonist played by washington is a wee bit too untouchable hes never really in any imminent lifethreatening danger that isnt easily handled by his manchurian candidate situational awareness combat mode hes always the one dealing the cards and in control of every situation in other words he walks into a situation and always comes out unscathed this smacked me as a bit too watertight one of the appeals of a herovigilante story is their story arc rise fall and rise again it seems to me the main character has no real fall its more like hes reached the top and there is no bottom hes basically a demigod of sorts would rate the story one more star possibly even if theyd managed to make the main character less than immortal there is a thrill seeing them overcome seemingly insurmountable odds but it seems there were no odds for the equalizer to surmount he had it all figured out before the conflicts even started which is the movies only weakness otherwise outstanding acting by everyone involved pacing was great and overall a good story,0.4975,1

Predictable,shinrisen,10 September 2023,5,the equalizer is one of those older male actor seems like a regular joe but is essentially a superhero when he really needs to be to save insert something and beat up the foreign bad guys type of movies denzel washington works at home depot where everyone loves him and wants to hang out with him he frequents a diner where a young escort girl also hangs out and they sometimes talk one day the girl gets beat up by her russian pimp thus enabling denzel to go on a massive killing spree of russian mobsters his special power is the ability to observe and calculate how much seconds hes gonna need to kill everyone so he observes and kills a whole lot of people while everyone keeps being impressed by how lethal and mysterious he is this movie came out in the same year as the first john wick movie and they are comparable in many ways the action choreography in john wick is a lot better than in this movie which elevates the entire movie this movie its mostly okay its extremely predictable and basic and while i was going to give it a for being fine if you like this type of stuff im going to drop it to a half a point since it was way too long for this type of flick and half a point since the ending was even for this movie pretty dumb,0.6652,1

similar to Taken (2008),NijazBaBs,8 February 2021,10,i liked this movie good topic action actors skills technology feelings although it is negative it is reasonable logical motivational bit more deep and brutal than taken sequels of liam neeson it is professional and although it lacks emotions that taken has this has more action and skills that is what i deserved from movie that lasts longer reminds me of real world topics and words like prostitution human trafficking and corruption the main characters here looks like some savior experienced serious but also sane smart moral comparable to real life topics and issues with the said topics of crime corruption dirty money cant wait to see next sequel,-0.7079,0
No equal like Denzel,videorama-759-859391,20 January 2015,8,at first in the early part i was a little worried as i know how these revenge pics go where the surrounding atmosphere of story isnt new a good hearted guy robert mccall ex cia washington avenges a brutal attack on a teen prostitute a sexy chloe moretz not the first time in a role like this whos caught up with the russian mafia we know all too well after films like eastern promises what these scum are like the movie had me thinking in its earlier stage it wsnt cutting it for me as the movie progresses luckily it avoids not falling into that trite seen it before scenario where it uses smarts in its plotting where we see more bad guys getting away with stuff one incident unrelated involving a robbery with denzel returning a hammer to his place of business and robbery scene implying a bit of face reconstruction to that poor robber denzels character mccall is such a smart cookie we dont know what his next trick is which make its fun its waiting and suspense prior denzel had taken out like eight bad russian dudes in a swift slick method of kill which has you thinking back to the boondock saints what hes done has opened up a can of worms the movie cranks it up after its first thirty five minutes one bad russian dude like a mafia godfather also no dummy has arrived in town setting the story further in motion where hes intent to get the truth despite his unwelcome presence from some associates and bad eggs un russian where to him hes just a visitor quickly they learn hes sorely mistaken always with denzel we have to watch him act as if visual proof to realize what he can bring to each character he doesnt really have to try to act he just bes that character where in no way has his acting ever slacked an older bull pullman and melissa leo also cia once though leos character works for the secretary department there now though small in roles must be acknowledged for their strong performances particularly leo the equalizer is a smart slick thriller a new refreshing vigilante film where the time has been right for a new one sort of death wish style the action climax is protracted though yet explosive in its resolution of its final chief baddie in a cool slo mo atmospheric shot of denzel where overhead sprinklers send many streaks of rain catching his face as is on the movie poster which reminds you of the sin city one and denzel goes after everyone and i mean everyone in an after ending just recently like the one in sabotage also speaking of sabotage a warehouse of moolah our agents stumble upon here gegives new meaning to the term surplus the final reuniting scene of moretz and washington was so predictable though but necessary,-0.8636,0
Unnecessary Long Film,oguzhan-55955,27 April 2024,5,im indecisive about it deserves point it took over than hours also not include real time conversations denzel washingtons performance was very impressive if he doesnt in the cast it could be unbearable the film is complicated it could give more information about mccall i wanted to learn his family childhood education and previous achievments the action scenes are amazing especially denzel washington was good his tactics are logical but russian mafia is ineffective they could be better finally i watch the movie but i dont recommend anyone probably i wont watch the equalizer,0.6789,1
A Wesley Snipes movie,Solaris88,13 September 2015,4,this is a wesley snipes movie in which they inexplicably managed to hire denzell to play snipes role really its a b movie the story is not just dumb it is painfully dumb in fairness the actors do a good job considering the dreck they had to work with marton csokas and chloe moretz especially do nice work denzell who is now on the wrong side of sixty is miscast in the perfect killing machine role but the actors cannot redeem this movie from its preposterous story line how this managed a on imdb is mindblowing i guess theres a lot of people out there whod watch a film of denzell reading names from the phone book and call it art,0.4198,1
tgchan says YES / www.tgchan.pl,tgchan,13 January 2015,5,i am really excited about this one training day is one of my favourite movies of all time and the equalizer is made by the same director i just wish david ayer would have joined this party along with antoine fuqua and denzel washington hes a great writer lets not hope for the worst it might be still very good and i honestly hope so lets go minutes nothing really worth mentioning nice cityscapes the story doesnt really bore you and you still wait for a big boom to happen any minute the only think i dont like is the weak screenplay it seems like it is going to be another type of movie where a super tough guy saves the girl because someone hits her etc bla bla bla this is why i wish david ayer would have written the story instead minutes holy mother of god now that was something worth to see a little bit overdone but still nice and good looking high octane action minutes the story is cheesy and there are plenty of situations over which you cringe but the action is good and it kind of equals things out minutes ok it starts to be ridiculous and stupid do you really will sacrifice decent movie just to pack more action in it mr director even spiderman and superman together didnt have so many opportunities to help the innocent haha now i even me along with the bad guys want to know who the hell is this guy jesus christ i cant believe what i am seeing it cant be so retarded it just cant hah for you mr director that was nice i almost lost the hope there for a moment pathetic with every minute its getting worse and worse a perfect example of what happens when a good writer is not there to make a proper story the movies is empty full of action without any common sense logic and purpose tgchans rating,0.4204,1

Denzel has the Steven Seagal sickness,puzgolac,23 October 2023,2,theres this guy who is an ex super special something the best smartest and wisest at everything who left his mysterious past behind and just wants to live peacefully in seclusion but the world just wont let him so he has to kick some but again sounds familiar that is every steven seagals movie in the past years and it is also this movie denzel is this mysterious super senior citizen who was the best at everything imaginable he is also the only one who ever managed to retire form his mysterious job because you know it was the you dont get out of this life kind of job of course i suspect he had to retire because otherwise he would have collapsed the us economy by making the whole military industry obsolete because you dont need other soldiers fighter jets tanks aircraft carriers and nuclear missiles when you have denzl seagal in your arsenal so rather than recapping the plot because it is nonsensical here are just some of the stupidities and annoyances that this movie is full of denzel superman is not only the strongest toughest and the best fighter but he also has to be the smartest and wisest so he reads classic books because you know books automatically mean much brain we are also subjected to his quasi intellectual advice the kind of you can get from cringey facebook posts that he dishes out to the people around him and they are all in such an awe of him he is also supposed to be this kind friendly and caring person though the movie inadvertently proves him to actually be a sadistic psychopath actually worse than the main villain who is just putting on a facade denzel even felt the need to have a scene where he steals a catch from a teammate during a baseball game just so that it would be him who scores the point and not the other guy that is aboveseagal level of egomania right there super denzel somehow also knows everything about everyone he knows the main villains childhood history even though he didnt know who the guy was he knows the corrupt cops phone number how well let me give you an example of the brilliant writing in this movie how did you get this number it wasnt hard wow pure brilliance the main villain is supposed to be this ex spetznaz which is the russian equivalent of a seal yet he is so incompetent that it is completely laughable during his very first fight he would have been killed if not for the crooked cop watching his back he is supposed to have been the head of a branch of secret police yet during his investigation he alerts denzel that he is onto him by doing the worst impersonation of a police officer in history he is also unable to kill denzel when he is within spitting distance from him but instead just barely wounds him and then proceeds to very slowly chase him and by chase i mean go in the opposite direction the super special team of bad guys leave the room with the hostages where they have every tactical advantage over denzel and instead go to search for him and of course get killed they also inexplicably dont kill any of the hostages even though they were given a direct order from their boss just because they heard some music over pa why didnt they start killing hostages and thus forced super grandpa to come to them a lowly henchman has all the evidence needed to incriminate the big boss including the neatly listed names of corrupt politicians and the amount of money they were paid because you know mobsters keep the evidence of their crimes lying around and lowly henchmen have unrestricted access to it and the big russian mobster has this super criminal empire and he is insulated from everything yet one man is able to destroy his empire in less than a week including going to moscow and killing him and another hundred of his bodyguards because why not in fact if the movie lasted for another half an hour im sure that super denzel could have eradicated crime completely in the whole world half a days work for him in spite of all of this action the action scenes themselves are slow and not numerous because obviously denzel cant do them anymore while seagal can at least flail his arms wildly about denzels action is slow and clunky and he even sometimes pauses briefly during an action scene to strike a cool pose which is completely ridiculous much of the action happens off screen doesnt actually show denzel doing it or just shows him staring into his victim like a complete psychopath add to this the meandering plot corrupt cops that extort small businesses whats the point home depot robbery whats the point the home depot psycho home alone remake during the final battle and many many other things this movie is nowhere near a,-0.9519,0
This must be a joke !,uttam-paudel,1 January 2015,3,i love danzel washington and his movies but his character robert must be a superhero a one man army the people behind the movie should have known this pretty well seen a couple of sunny deol movies from bollywood where any human is equally capable towards the end it goes off the roof robert lands in moscow king the kingpin and all his associates in their den just like that shitty imdb rating of made me watch this one i rate this a at most nothing special nothing that is all i want to write about the movie but i am required to write at least lines about a movie that i liked nothing about common thats unfair let me post this review,0.9104,1
All Hype and no substance,ramesh-khanna,25 November 2014,5,the first minutes of the movie was good but after that the story just sags nowhere near training day quality or story sad that it is a denzel washington movie and we do not see much of his acting skills if you have nothing else to do on a boring weekend afternoon then go watch the equalizer intersteller and gone girl were much better than equalizer the first minutes of the movie was good but after that the story just sags nowhere near training day quality or story sad that it is a denzel washington movie and we do not see much of his acting skills if you have nothing else to do on a boring weekend afternoon then go watch the equalizer intersteller and gone girl were much better than equalizer,-0.1779,0
Good movie until terrible ending,demac-128-69685,8 October 2014,5,was very interesting until final showdown all the actors were top notch with the hand to hand fight scenes well done then it turned into a remake of home alone at the home depot i loved denzel in man on fire one of my all time favorite movies its a shame they had to ruin the ending of this movie i felt insulted and cheated out of when you have machine guns laying there for you to shoot the bad guys with what would you do nope he uses tools and supplies from the home depot shelves to do battle with maccauley culkin would be proud i wonder if the director was paying homage to john huston with the traps and tricks used,-0.7357,0

I have just lost almost two hours of my life,marian-c-rotariu,25 December 2014,5,if you love happy pill movies this was a very good movie very entertaining that makes you feel great and enjoy life now please move on to the next reviews select only the good ones and write about the haters that wrote the bad reviews chop chop if you dont like happy pill movies and you dont like denzel reading these reviews is such a waste of your precious time i think you agree with me that this was a very bad movie so my advice to you is to forget it because even if you try to advise people not to watch it some of them might still do it out of curiosity to see how bad movies can be nowadays if you are still reading this you probably hate happy pill movies but you find yourself helplessly fond of denzel what a poor and lonely soul you are such a great actor and such a bad movie clearly need some more supporting words and some more power to think about other parallel worlds in which denzel still plays in very goods movies infinite possibilities but nevertheless you are in a world in which the bad thing has happened i dont even know where to start from so much physical and mental power in a single man that can make superman envious at least superman had extraterrestrial overpower and a ridiculous costume the only scene that exceeds mediocre level is the table scene between the two confronting sides those looks and the dialogue are to be remembered im giving this high mark only for this scene and for the overall denzels performance,0.5885,1
One of Denzel's worst performances - soul-less and generic,stroggos,28 March 2020,3,everything about this movie is generic the music the lights even the fighting with some pretty corny cinematography to round things off i generally really like denzel washington as an actor but he gives such a lackluster performance in this one and i think he has been miscast or at least been misdirected by a director who does not seem to have a unique vision at all denzels characters back story is something that we have seen time and time again but it comes off as unbelievable here on top of that the story is so badly structured with some characters that play a big role early on seemingly forgotten for the rest of the film altogether a huge disappointment,-0.0233,0
"A Poorly Written Story, Carried by Great Acting",D_I_Sammi,19 April 2024,4,this is one of the best performances from denzel washington who perfectly encapsulates an interesting grounded and wholesome protagonist whom we can really route for and his dialogue is some of the best he has ever been given marton csokas is a quality actor who does the evil henchman act with a fun and slimy delivery however the plot story and events are half baked and the world building is poor this is a result of clear bmovie limitations but i also suspect a lack of imagination from the writers this is a terrible shame because the right elements were here all ready for a top tier action thriller with strong character but the result is lazy and hollow,0.0129,1
What do you see? A mix bag...,dangent280,30 December 2014,5,i vaguely remember seeing the previous fuquawashington effort training day before i began watching the equalizer and my overall feeling once the credits began to roll was to watch it as soon as possible in order to reassure it couldnt be as bad as the film i had just watched on the negative side the equalizer is overlong minutes easily could be cut from the film overviolent i know its an action film but it just seemed to deter from the seriousness of the tone it was trying to achieve and rather quite silly in places on the positive side washington gives a good performance but thats pretty much about it,0.9499,1
Another Mess by Antoine Fuqua,j-a-julian,2 March 2019,3,first of all i made the mistake of seeing the equalizer before this film was terribly misdirected and virtually impossible to understand now that ive seen i understand a bit more about but sequels should be able to stand on their own and fuqua totally failed on that point of course denzels performance is excellent as always but in general this and are simply not worth your time to watch i cannot understand how antoine fuqua gets directing gigs,-0.5911,0

Way too much action,misscalv,1 November 2014,4,the movie starts kinda slow with robert mccall denzel washington doing his daily routine it is sort of essential for the movie to show how he lives now appose to how he lived before and will live later so i get it but i still think they should have cut some of it but okay and then the action starts when the store he works in gets robbed and teri chloë grace moretz gets beaten up by the russians and the first fight sequence happens and its epic when he kills all the russians and in that moment the movie is awesome but then it just goes downhill from there you kinda get to know more about who he was before but not really and you dont get to see teri before the end of the movie again so basically the rest of the movie is just him killing people to get revenge and stay alive and it gets old really fast this movie just has too much action and are lacking a solid story and thats why it really bored me and the only reason i give it a and not a is because i think the movie had some great actors if the sequel does happen i really hope there is less action but i doubt it because of how this one ended so ill probably wont go see it,-0.8787,0
so so movie...I expected more...:(,singh-akshay86,23 December 2014,5,being a fan of denzel washington and action movies i was very thrilled to see this movie but i was a bit disappointed after seeing the movie it was no different than any other superhero movie except that our hero had no uniform this time and without any special powers it seemed too farfetched mr mccall here is a one man army who managed to wipe out the entire russian mafia without using any hitech gadgets or weaponsshame on you batman ironman no doubt denzel is a great actor and he and antoine fuqua worked pretty good in training day but i expected more from this one overall the action and fight sequences in the film are okmccall being a quiet person with great combat skill it sure does reminds you of liam neesontaken and jason bournethe bourne seriesbut they too cant hold a candle to him when it comes to taking out the entire mafia outfit who says you need a game plan to take out the mafia headyou just walk into his mansion kill everyone and just walk outwhat a joke taking him out was much easier than killing his best soldier disappointed,0.3312,1
"basically a reboot of a classic, with bad-ass attitude",kosie42,7 October 2014,5,i went to watch the movie tonight most of my expectations were met from the trailer of the movie it was clear the movie was out to exploit the theme of man on fire with the same actor off course the masses must be attracted to go watch the movie to make money and not rather entertain the audience this is not a classic equalizer as we remember rather a reboot of the original tv series a more rrated badass theme which basically do not justice to the original character however the little interaction between denzil chloe is definitely standout scenes funnily with way toned down violence the theme of redemption rather than revenge do help the film as well as a little pathos and empathy between the the main characters hardly hurt the film the movie is brutal some might say realistic but the normal expected action with gory violence and some cleverness infused from the main character action thriller fans will like the movie which might rather have been called another title a badass reboot of a classic yeah but not for the intellectual it could have been refined more with the same storyline but with much more intellect to the viewers go watch it if youd like to leave your senses at the door,0.6258,1
More Than Just Another Denzel Washington Action Movie?,FilmMuscle,29 September 2014,5,antonie fuqua director of training day has created another harsh and energetic vehicle for his star denzel washingtonanother determined warrior whos out for noholdsbarred vengeance the equalizer for that matter has a lot of styletheres no doubt about that its cinematography is genuinely impressive permeated by shots of glistening skyscrapers luxury cars and heavily stylized slomo portions but its ultimately all too familiar the russians of course represent the onedimensional villains here who merely function as tools to showcase washingtons wild skill set the tone of the film is certainly its strongest suitvery gritty and dark in a glossy cosmopolitan setting thats oftentimes seen at night there are plenty of painful deaths and an abundance of blood to be seen other than that the plot gets rather ridiculous very fast in fact we discover soon that its wonderful tone actually isnt very fitting for the content of the movie a world thats initially established with realism beginning to introduce compelling themes and displaying how robert mccall denzel washington strives to be a better manstrict exercise and diet regimens relaxed dinners with classic literary works placed right by his plate and an optimistic philosophy with which he helps improve his friends and colleagues as well we quickly learn that hes clearly a man of dignity integrity and selfrespect quite the compelling start into the first twenty minutes the narrative first fleshes out the tedious routines of his every day until we run into chloe moretzs character teri though shes given disappointingly little screen time moretz as usual shines with every minute shes givena deeply vulnerable adolescent whose innocence glimmers from her eyes slowly and tragically vanishing while shes raised in a strongly depraved environment as a hooker for the russian mafia she doesnt see through the same hopeful eyes that robert does and there we see two completely irreconcilable worlds encounter one anotherthat of the ponderously cynical and that of the buoyant or even shall i say naïve can we truly change the environment in which we have already developed ourselves just how plausible is this seemingly mythical betterment of self these are some of several philosophical concepts and quiet moments of character introspection and reflection as the austere streets of boston somewhat resembling the ambiance of s gone baby gone outside their windows go on by well all of that potential is quickly squandered as the equalizer jarringly metamorphoses into a blatant clichéd action flick that becomes less and less remarkable as it progresses with his gimmicky watchsetting and slowmotion maneuvering around any given predicament you suspect that mccall might just be another unstoppable superhero after all whereas man on fire a film that can easily be compared to this one mixes emotion with a hellbent denzelhunting down the kidnappers onebyone with realistically brutal methodsthis movie on the other hand becomes incredibly outlandish when the protagonist begins effortlessly killing dozens of baddies in one confined arena magically having enough time to implement creativity into each take down as well and you know washington plays a character he has portrayed many times before deadly serious and tough as nails in his manner of speech and physicality in addition its runtime of hours and minutes doesnt grant it any favors either the final explosive sequence runs on for far too long and feels like it took up almost a quarter of the film in the movies first action segments the grisly violence is undoubtedly shocking as well as exciting by the end it becomes monotonous and unspectacular the violence is by then cleverly shadowed as to dramatically reduce its severity i guess its the implied ways by how theyre executed that occasionally provoke the squirms from the audience but even after that prolonged final confrontation the film unnecessarily continues with multiple additional scenes as washington somehow masterfully climbs even farther up the mafia ladder with fueling revenge the impeccably stimulating score by the evertalented harry gregson williams screams with the same tragic emotion and melancholy that man on fire did but never effectively translates that onto the screen if only there was creativity applied to its insipid story and a more grounded approach complementing the grittiness of its tone the equalizer couldve made for a memorable action film at the end of the day though audiences will likely remember it as just another denzel washington action movie among many,0.9299,1
Very conventional thriller,fabianotto,22 October 2018,5,the equalizer was somehow difficult to review since the movie never clearly shows where it wants to go without spoiling the story for people who are still interested in watching this movie it is a very conventional american thriller about that lonesome guy who gets tipped over the edge and starts killing people the movie barely evolves above tv storytelling and tv characters it tries to be cool and stylish at times and a bit deathwishlike but it fails to establish any kind of originality without denzel washington and he plays the loner well this movie would probably lose every incentive to watch it,-0.7001,0

As expected,Alanjackd,1 June 2015,5,you get what you expect from this its a revenge flick doesnt ask for anything else just a few hours attentiontypical good guy versus bad guy stuff with nasty russians thrown in then thrown out man on fire it certainly is not but it does not pretend to be eithertaking its name from the tv series seems rather odd but there you goden washington does a great job as a brooding nobody who used to be a somebodygood fight scenes that get a tiny bit silly toward the end but its all done with the best intentions probably the start of a franchise good movie making and a step up from the usual revenge flickjust checked my watch,0.5096,1
"Slow-Paced, Dull, Cliché Action Movie",SquigglyCrunch,22 October 2015,4,im not a particularly big fan of movies like this where action drives the story over characters or plot itself however i heard this one was good and the ratings were good enough so i watched it as you can see by my rating that didnt go down well the equalizer is nothing special its got a lame plot thats probably been used hundreds of times i wouldnt know because i dont typically watch these kinds of movies and its just overall not interesting now with a title like the equalizer and a cover like the one it has how could i expect a good story right i mean im being unreasonable arent i in that sense yes but i didnt go into this movie expecting an oscar winner i expected an overdone action movie and dang this movie did not deliver the action was slow and excruciatingly boring there was absolutely nothing special or unique about it now i understand its hard to have unique violence these days considering how many action movies there are but it felt like they didnt even try it was all just very dull and boring to watch despite the punches and resourcefulness that washingtons character displayed the characters themselveswell theres really only one and hes probably the most lame action hero ive ever seen the terminator was at least entertaining to watch and john wick at least had a significant focus on his past the equalizer himself just felt unoriginal hes the most stereotypical hero ever and nothing about him is interesting the supporting characters are underdeveloped and i really felt like i couldnt care less about what happened to them in the end overall the equalizer is just a big waste of time like i said i havent seen a heck of a lot of action movies like this but ive seen enough to know that there is absolutely nothing special about this one there wasnt even an attempt at originality and washingtons character felt like a total idiot throughout the entire thing and that fact was probably the most development he ever got in the end the equalizer was like i said a waste of time i dont know how else to describe it if you want to watch a good or at least enjoyable action movie watch kill bill or the terminator judgement day both of which are infinitely better i would not recommend this movie to you but if you really want to watch it then go right ahead i wont say it was awful but it just failed to deliver on so many levels all of which totaled up to just a bad movie,-0.9025,0
OK but not great,nicholls_les,14 June 2016,5,not a bad film by any means but it could have been so much better it is hard to know where it failed as denzel is his usual brilliant best and chloë grace moretz was incredibly good i also cant really blame the story line as it was pretty standard for this type of movie but maybe thats the problem it follows the usual hollywood formula and other movies have done this sort of thing much better i also though there was far too much profanity i am not a prude but it was just over used by a few characters i also thought that the end scene could have been better i didnt find a lot of what robert mccall did was overly clever and that is the whole point of the equalizer so overall i would say this is a watchable movie but not one i will be too keen to watch again,0.9915,1

"Denzel does ""The Stare"" and ""The Silly""",daddysarm,18 April 2024,5,main problem with the equalizer is it is just too long the pace is moody to be polite it seems even longer due to the annoying generic sound track could they not afford real music this soundtrack was neither appropriate nor good in its own way main character is not credible being retired for some period of time never shown working out to maintain his reflexes skills yet he is as good as ever on top of that the story has been done over and over the characters are predictable stereotypes i swear i saw jason statham in this exact story the minute search destroy action scene in the store at the end is so bad it has to be satire part of the minutes is dw handfighting a bad guy for almost minutes which is plenty of time for all the other bad guys to think hey i should probably go over there where all that noise is happening oh brother and i cannot be the only one who thought home alone when he picked up the barbed wire and the deathbydiyskus started btw no way that drill would penetrate fast enough to kill that guy his head would have moved forward a drill needs to be pressed against something stiff immovable,-0.9836,0

Pretty Classic,InTilligenter,23 February 2023,5,the idea behind the equalizer is not very original some exagent guy in retirement forced to fight an underground organization which must be of course russian nethertheless this movie is mostly fun to watch the action scenes and mainly the perfomance of denzel wachington are probably the biggest arguments for recommandation though i had an issue with the general plot after seeing many movies of this kind following events wont surprise you and the final confrontation is scripted after the general scheme of action movies the final battle has to take place in the hardware store robert works at and in the end his one fellow from work the security guy has his little moment by running half dead through home art to switch the lights on good job by the way the main antagonist played by marton csokas is being mafiastyle the hole movie after no character is developing throughout the story you can see that teddy is no real threat to our hero there is one scene describing this issue when bob meets his former collegues from secrete whatsoever and asks them for permission to destroy the hole mafia organization by himself he is the perfect man from the beginning to the end and the only time he struggles is towards the end when teddy gets a shot at him obviously this does not make any difference because bob can kill teddy despite the fact he is wounded without any effort in conclusion i wouldnt reallly recommend watching this film if you havent done it yet because there is few innovative content there are better movies like john wick concentrating on one primary aspect like action sequences that i would rather watch the equalizer is a solid actionmovie having no new ideas,-0.8886,0
"Too long, man",leonkosc,23 December 2018,5,so i watched this movie couse becouse of christmas i have some free time and i just wanted to watch good simple action movie to relax my problem with the equalizer is the fact that its over two hours long and thats way too much becouse the plot is very simple hour and a half would be just fine but it feels just way to long action scenes are fine theyre not nearly as good as fight scenes in john wick but theyre fine my problem is that they were too dark and it wasnt always clear whats happening i really liked the actors denzel washington was good but chloe moretz stole every scene she was in she was as great as usually the other thing that was missing for me was some humor but its not a big flow overall its okey if you havent seen john wick or new mission impossible movies or a man from u n c l e i recomend any of those over the equalizer but if you have and you like action movies itll do alright,0.9697,1
All typical topics of thrillers mixed only to justify too much blood,lordon,21 July 2015,3,denzel washington has discovered invisibility he can walk through the city killing all the bad guys but no one ever see him he is so proud of his invisibility that he even rejects taking the guns when he has the opportunity and armed guys in front of him because it is fancier to kill them with his own hands or whatever devices he finds around to make the movie bloodier than needed of course he gives the bad guys the opportunity to repent from their sins but they reject and he feels obliged to kill them typical justification of the capital punishment of so many american movies all this spiced with the so original wuthering past of a guy who does not like what he does but is forced to do it by the reality the corrupt policemen and the dumb friend who finally becomes a hero if not calling the police when several armed guys are trying to kill someone could be considered a heroicity,-0.9885,0

Dull Deus Ex Punchina,FloodClearwater,27 August 2015,5,we could call the equalizer a thoughtful extreme action flick because of how much quiet time denzel washington explores while on screen carefully arranging small household objects ruminating over coffee and a newspaper et cetera before the buttkicking action starts between denzel and a local vodkafavored mob what is not thoughtful is a noticeable lack of exposition and character fleshing sequences that might explain precisely what the middleage protagonists life story is and how precisely he can map a fight out in his mind in advance just like guy ritchies robert downey jrs sherlock holmes and then autocad his movements so that he can whip up on well lets not spoil it a lot of people i mentally jumped with glee at the chance to follow a strong and quiet denzel through this film once the fisticuffs started cuffing i couldnt help but glory in each of his undeveloped characters triumphs in handtohand combat and in outfoxing the snarling tattooed baddies the film sets him against but a movie has to be more than a storyboard sketch of a bully story with adults drawn in and a sequence of crunchy gushing fight scenes and this is a movie with denzel washington philadelphia glory the hurricane malcom x crimson tide oily studio types leave denzel out of this undernourishing film flam approach in the future leave the deusexpunchina to steven segal and projects striving for general mediocrity we always complain about too much exposition we groan dear god this is duller than george lucas and his damn metichloriants but you know what too little exposition is just as frustrating,-0.9597,0

Shown So Much on Cable Might As Well Have Its Own Channel,bkkaz,30 March 2022,5,okay so the tv series this has almost nothing to do with except for the title and name of the main character is terrific at least for its first two seasons yes it was hokey but the late edward woodward played robert mccall to perfection a very human if flawed man who was a brilliant spy but at least to his understanding not so much father husband and human being his nightmarish past of dirty tricks catches up with him and now firmly in middle age he sees a chance for redemption this movie lacks just about every element of that very important redemption story here robert mccall is essentially a psychopath one small heartbeat above the terminator he kills with the brutal efficiency of a machine lives a life that is robotic his acetic apartment is even like benders in futurama and is the hero less for redemption and more because he cant quite shake off his old violent ways theres stuff in here about the russian mob and some oligarch thats timely with the ukraine thing but theyre all stock types in what is a pretty routine if low budget bloodbath youve seen everything here before but in slightly different form worse you find out almost nothing about mccall of any value except to service the plot the tv show was slick in how it worked in character bits here and there so that the tapestry became as important as the plot of individual episodes it wasnt a character arc in the way serialized shows these days do it but it was pretty close it worked denzel washington is denzel washington like with deniro these days this is an effort where hes basically playing the same guy as in the last movies antoine fuquas direction is like being in a music video that cant quite figure out if its heavy metal or r and b none of this is bad exactly but none of it is truly good either its just adequate with no suspense and only occasional pay off for the violent set ups that punctuate the meandering story the equalizer no more like the averagizer,0.9767,1

Denzell Washington Makes A Movie With Antoine Fuqua,boblipton,17 December 2020,4,denzell washington works at a home depot in boston when he isnt doing that he sits in a diner reading books and chatting with the other customers including prostitute chloe grace moretz or helping an overweight security guard try to get in shape so he can become a rescue worker then miss moretz is kidnapped and beat to a pulp and he proceeds to take down the russian mob operation that killed her its a revivalprequel to the tv show from the in which edward woodward would help small people fight back against the big nasties of the world it was a pleasantly fantastic premise and washington as always convinces me that he is that man director antoine fuqua directs with his usual pornographic love of violence its appropriate here although his director of photography mauro fiore chooses an odd color palette that suggests that home depot only uses natural light while the streets of boston are lit by artificial light during the daytime,0.7783,1

I thought it would be more interesting.,MorpheusOne,15 November 2021,4,stars out of ten from what i had seen in the trailers that i saw the movie looked a lot more interesting than it actually ended up being not that the ocd of the title character made no sense at all but it was out of place in a similar context not that the character having no family made no sense at all it did seemfeel out of place at least because it would have been more interesting to see the character with something of a real life and one that which goes beyond their job at the fake home depot their former career as a member of g i joe two of the dumbest things that i have ever seen in any movie ever are the dirty cops taking from the small business owners then giving the money back now obviously those people should have gotten their money back but this narrativesubplot makes no sense given the context of who those two idiots actually worked for the morbidly massive level of unlikeliness involved in the odds of them returning the money even with the threat of their pig careers in the balance because of a cell phone video how did the fake home depot employee lady get her ring back now we know how she got the ring back the title character got the plate number there you go but there was no explanation one might say that there needs to be no explanation to which i would respondyoure right in a story this terrible why bother the movie really does not begin to take a turn for the worse however until it becomes a predictable stew which is at about the climax of this tedious film when the bad guys take the title characters fellow fake home depot employees hostage and of course they must be saved and of course the title character gets shot and he burns his wounds closed their prices are too high ill shop somewhere else,-0.9941,0

Perfectly Average,truemythmedia,15 June 2019,5,this movie came and went quietly from my personal perspective but for a certain demographic this movie was a smash i work at a video store and i cant count the number of times people ask for it are frustrated we are out of it or ask if the new one which is just now releasing in theaters is out on dvd yet now that the new on is dropping i thought i would see what the fuss is about after all just because it had flown under my radar didnt mean it was bad i would love to say that this movie was outstanding but it wasnt id love to rant about how terrible it was but it wasnt it was just a solidly made movie that doesnt do anything really outstanding its the sort of movie that fills video shelves that gets made because we demand more entertainment and no one can keep up i dont really understand why people were so gaga for it even if you like any part of this movie there are other movies that do that thing better if you like the fight scenes john wick is better if you like the saving of the girl in it you were never really here or taken does that better if you like the russian mob stuff eastern promises is better if you like antoine fuqua or denzel washington training day is better literally the only reasons i can think of to see this movie are if you are a denzel washington completionist or if youll just see anything hes in i know im going to end up seeing the sequel probably because ill need to review it but i dont really know why there is nothing in this film that demands one thought it left room open for one i suppose every aging actor has to try and liam neeson it these days but i dont expect it to be any better than taken,0.9932,1

Unsatisfying payback,Mr-Fusion,20 September 2022,5,big fan of denzel and revenge movies and when the two intersect i am allin sign me up baby sadly the equalizer is no man on fire and no ones more deflated by that than me chlöe grace moretz is the underage sex worker who after her pimp viciously sends her to the icu is what sends our protagonist on his vigilante spree moretzs narrative presence is almost strictly bookends and i really think a bigger involvement wouldve helped denzel has plenty to do but the movie lacks tony scotts visceral charge or even the comedic violence of nobody i know that comparing movies isnt helpful but the equalizer is too serious for its own good and i just didnt have any fun seeing this guy lay waste to the russian mob its not bad per se but apart from the novel use of a nail gun theres not much here to remember let alone fondly,-0.8433,0
The Equalizer,phubbs,17 February 2015,5,a movie based on an old late s american tv series but only very thinly it is in fact more of an origins plot showing how the main character becomes a vigilante for hireor the equalizer the actual story we see here and the main character are nothing to do with the original tv show unless this plot is similar to a certain episode i dont know the premise is a very simple one retired black ops government agent mccall washington is friends with a hooker called alina moretz alina is working for the russian mob one night mccall witnesses some of the gang members abuse alina and a few days later she turns up in hospital badly beaten this upsets mccall so he visits the head of the local russian mob and offers to buy her freedom the bad guys basically laugh at mccallso he kills them all thusly a war is started between mccall and the russian mob this movie bears a striking similarity to another glossy revenge thrillerjohn wick very similar in fact there wick goes on the warpath over his dead puppy here mccall goes on the warpath over a rather sleazy looking lady of the night the puppy i can understand because everyone likes puppiesdogs your pet is your best friend part of the family the sleazy prostitute on the other hand im not so sure how do you even know if this girl isnt a druggie if youll ever see her again if shell even be gratefulwho can tell risky gamble if you ask me so i guess mccall sees something special in this rather young prostitute and decides to put his whole life on the line despite the fact he doesnt even know her that well from what we see from this point on its your predictable clichéd stereotypical one man army job with washington killing everyoneeveryone this movie is all about giving the bad guys payback so expect lots of slow motion highly impressive fight choreography that looks slick as fck but you know damn well would probably get you nowhere in a real scuffle washington has obviously been trained in various techniques that weve all seen before errrjohn wick and executes them flawlessly against various stereotypical russian baddies its not all about fisticuffs though there is plenty of gun play naturally some hightech gadgetry and spy stuff and even some good old fashioned ateamesque diy take downs utilising various objects actually the entire finale is set in a large homebase uk only styled warehouse so obviously you know things like drills nail guns wire etcwill be used to snuff the villains out ive always wondered how cool it would be to play war games in a place like that now i know everything looks super stylised and well shot lots of interesting camera angles great lighting with lots of shadow usage moody facial closeups excellent gun porn expensive cars expensive sets etcall the usual stuff as for the bad guys well its business as usual of course these guys are tattooed russians cue lots of ultra short haircuts and facial hair big bald guys bling made to measure outfits and holding your gun in the coolest way possible whilst looking twitchy its the usual stream of henchmen cannon fodder basically the only highlight being the main bad guy flown in to hunt down mccallteddy yep lets give him a silly soft sounding name thats really clever of us because in fact hes a nutcase and very tough this character in my opinion is simply a poor mans agent smith weaving from the matrix he dresses in a suit of course he looks the same same type of hairstyle same type of grimaces and even kinda talks the same to a degree russian accent aside again this movie is engaging but its not particularly good we know mccall is a badass but he does things that seem impossible when he kills the russians at the start he manages to enter and leave their busy club without anyone noticing or hearing the commotion when he sets up two crooked cops where the hell did he manage to get the cctv of them threatening the restaurant owner originally he pops up at locations outta nowhere and vanishes just as easily he takes down an entire money laundering operation way too easily single handed he manages to blow up an entire cargo ship at the docks single handed lastly when he had another crooked cop trapped in his car whilst flooding it with carbon monoxide why didnt the cop just break the glass or stop the window closingits just an electric window yes this is a lean mean kickass machine its very sleek well made and well directed but its just too damn unoriginal how many times have we seen this aside from the fact that john wick did the exact same thing around a month after this came out and a bit better the main issuesits too long and the movie is trying way too hard to be serious and gritty when basically its nonsense mccall manages to eradicate the entire russian crime syndicate in bostonand then he goes to russia and wipes them all out there too the fck if hes that good he could erase more crime syndicates singlehandedly all over you gotta ask yourself why he hasnt been used to do this before or why he hasnt decided to do so himself if he can so easily seriously hes just one retired black ops dude imagine what a whole team could do,-0.9562,0
Makes me miss Edward Woodward,s3276169,10 December 2014,5,edward woodwards the equalizer downplayed the violence that lay at the core of the character violence was a necessary evil but it was presented as something employed with regret and a certain analytic constrained precision its a shame then that whilst this updated film attempts to convey the same sentiment it fails to follow through taking almost boastful glee in the often ugly violence dished out by its main character played by denzel washington to add insult to injury the story line is hackneyed and predictable us arm of the russian mob threatens young girl who they cruelly exploit as a prostitute the result washingtons character rides in to save her along the way our hero uncovers corruption involving people in high places etc etc in summary the original equalizer worked because it was slick and sophisticated with understated violence that made the main character appear even more intimidating by contract this production uses a club where a scalpel would have been more appropriate the only bright spot being washington himself who is as engaging and talented as ever holding this film together in spite of its shortcomings a five out of but only just,-0.976,0

"How many times can you say ""WOW""",honyltd,11 October 2014,None,my memory of the equalizer was a late s television series of an older british actor named edward woodward who specialized in helping people with seemingly unsolvable problems the late richard jordan taken too early round out the cast it was a favored show this equalizer with denzel washington is no retread but a completely different take on a man who if you were the opposition would never want to challenge many times it has been said this is like the good guy version of training day the only legitimate comparison is that gifted director antoine fuqua was the director of each and already had his main stars persona in his head so of denzels skills were on view this movie is not formulaic perhaps some of you never met the russian mafia from the comfort of your jobs but they are every bit the savage seemingly unconcerned with consequences personalities that would affect any human not a sociopath without conscience or sense of morality fuqua uses diametric opposites in order to sharpen this intense as accurate a word as i can muster for this movie which makes no compromises you have denzel washingtons character never fully explained but clearly a former special forces commando i go with nsa over delta force or seals as he shows a calculating nonremorse for the job he has taken on avenging the beating of a russian prostitute who was left for dead and to whom he had a common late night eatery as a bonding point like clark kent by day mccall is an everyday home mart employee wellliked for his hard work and concern for his fellow employees but like bruce wayne when the former commando emerges he takes no prisoners leaves no walking wounded still unlike any other action movie his deeds all seem credible and believable in the end his fellow workers see the real robert mccall at the edge of your seat conclusion the last minutes of what turns out in the end to be an epic movie in scope he literally goes to the head of the snake after an unforgettable duel in the home mart which might as well be the main street in any western always true to his sense of justice good is good bad is trash to be taken out we are treated to a new genre subcategory the super action film an ordinary man capable of extraordinary acts of ten for a cant miss winner i guarantee you will like,0.9422,1
If you pray for rain you have to deal with the mud.,AVeryPrivateGentleman1,24 October 2017,None,the last time i reviewed this before it came out i got a barrage of insults then the post was removed and wasnt i wrong big time humble pie in abundance and i couldnt use mr mccalls coffee shop either i then had to go to my wardrobe and eat all my hats in one go this is an awesome movie and i can see exactly why casting is in the job they do and me im just some tuppence halfpenny mouthpiece trying to write a comment on a superlative piece of celluloid i think its why they call you the united states of america the movie speaks for itself and washington oh my dear lord was superlative it was worth the dvd all day long and more i love the scene with the tea bag in his local coffee shop reading his paperback books it has a lot more quality and class than the edward woodward tv series of the s does he get the black jag with the wide wheel arches in the sequel maybe they could give him a metallic black f type with a few modifications its quite funny because when my antidepressants dont work so well i put this film on and it makes you fell good this is washingtons signature career character every actor searches for one many never find it i prayed for the sun when i commentated last time and had to deal with the heat i am a big clooney fan i seriously love denzil in this but cant help wondering how george would have been in the role but better still he could do a sequel of the american and reprise his role of jack edward clarke the equalizer is definitely in my desert island top must haves ps is there any chance of a homage to the old s theme tune in the sequel movie,0.9735,1
Denzel Kicking Serious Bad-Dude-Ass as a Bad-Ass!,iNickR,6 November 2017,None,i sort of remember the mids tv series the equalizer and i sort of remember watching a few episodes i certainly dont remember the late edward woodward kicking serious baddudeass like denzel washington does as robert mccall first the bad news i know every baddudeasskicker looks good in the neardark lit only by a single xenon sitting high atop a skyjack yards yonder with the pouring rain twinkling all around in the background and rolling off said baddudeasskickers weathered face and squared jaw but was it really necessary here i mean come on it looked like it was done on purposeand not in a good way the scene im talking about could have been shot somewhere else to have the same impact worst shot ever more bad news open memo to hollywood we get it the russians are the bad guys again but please stop for the love of igor stop using nonrussian speaking actors to fill the roles needed especially henchmen and smaller speaking roles we hate it when russians are actually americans pretending to be russian after spending an hour with a dialect coach in their trailer before their scene im looking at youwhoshallnotbenamedbutstarredin indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull ok so i exaggerated that a teeny bit but her accent was terrible in that movie anyway i digress for this movie im talking about the horrible russian spoken by chloë grace moretz she plays an underage russian prostitute with perfect english but horrible russian i guess thats better than a horrible english accent and horrible russian i knew nothing about the plot of the movie and i didnt even know she was a russian prostitute until the bad guys showed up chloë is a great actress and for her limited screen time did wellsave for the parts where she needed to speak russian for the sake of credibility another talented and beautiful female actress from russia could have worked just fine its a small role with limited screen time even chloës name on the onesheet seemed like an afterthought now the good news denzel belovedly referred to as dedushka grandfather by the russians and pops by his coworkers at the local home mart and thats another thing why not make a little sponsorship cash and have robert mccall work at home depot seriously kicks some baddudeass his character is a little ocd i can relate and quite inventive oh the things one can do with a corkscrew in under seconds i loved denzel in tony scotts man on fire he was almost born to play these kinds of characters i know right the equalizer is a good action film that will keep your attention but no gnarly s tunes to bring you back to the days when a middle aged edward woodward was playing the dedushka hmm the russians were our enemies then too,0.3083,1
It's no Equalizer but worth watching for Csokas performance alone,amesmonde,4 November 2014,None,helpful gentleman robert mccall is a retired black ops government operative who after befriending a young woman goes head to head with the russian mafia antoine fuquas the equalizer is stylishly violent with both denzel washington as robert mccall and marton csokas putting in tense and excellent performances harry gregsonwilliams score complements the dreary mood but lacks stewart copelands signature theme busy equalizing mirroring the recent sherlock holmes in terms of fighting logic this offering is more reminiscent of the get cater than the equalizer tv series writer richard wenk and fuquas drop nods to woodwards mccall a silhouette his ingenuity and stone cold shootings but its comparable to ridley scotts robin hood being an almost the equalizer prequel in terms of howwhy he becomes the equalizer overall put against fuquas own training day written by david ayer or in terms of being a film based on the equalizer it falls short that said as an atmospheric revenge action its wonderfully filmed highly entertaining and worth watching for csokas performance alone,-0.0554,0
superficial,rezased,23 June 2016,None,the virtue of helping the unprotected and tendency of eradicating roots of evil shown in the film is respectful but the role played by denzel was very clichéd another minus point is that the idea is that devil is from russiato cast the blame on a source out of the society confession of the ex kgb agent regarding that he has no emotions irritates the audience to induce and generalize this notion to russians finally i was expecting a much more sophisticated movie when i saw denzel washington was the actor it is just good for entertainment as superficial as bollywood films,0.1254,1
"A film that's taken a lot from ""Taken""",rogerdarlington,6 May 2015,None,a former secret agent with a special set of skills who has tried to leave all this behind him but is pulled back into the field when a young woman is badly treated by foreign thugs sound familiar this is very much the ground trodden by the taken franchise although the title of this film and the name of its lead character are borrowed from a television series of the late on the small screen edward woodward played a british former spy in this big screen version the role is filled by the charismatic denzel washingtion as excia it starts slow and remains pedestrian for halfanhour so then the action starts and rackets up and up to a major shootout in the hardware depot where robert mccall was previously a nondescript worker and now find original use for some of the tools on sale,0.3919,1
Better than expected,jjhoops7,26 October 2019,None,i really enjoyed this film denzel washington proves time and time again he has immense talents transforming what could be a generic action thriller into something fun and surprisingly emotional i cant imagine this movie being nearly as good without him his character moves from gentle and sympathetic to intense and heroic with frightening efficiency the movie never fully overcomes genre tropes but it is a fun ride nonetheless at its core this is an old man getting dragged back into the game story and it spends enough time building a wellrealized character with believable motivations denzel works a day job at a large hardwarehome store and spends late nights reading at a hour diner he takes sympathy for a young girl who is involved in a bad way with some russian dudes the story soon spirals into denzel takes on everyone he believes is justice and acts as a moral arbiter for the everyday person the down and out the action often revolve around denzel surveilling and taking out bad guys with oldman resourcefulness incorporating everyday tools and homegoods into the violence in a way this is suburban dad dream film and as such you dont have to take it too seriously my major gripes with the film the main villain is a cartoonish baddie he is one dimensional and boringly evil also every boston accent is a travesty even for hollywood boston accents this is not good denzel washington shrewdly avoids attempting one,-0.8049,0

Denzel is Great,billcr12,13 December 2014,None,the one reason to watch the equalizer is denzel washington he is bob a seemingly ordinary man working at a home depot type of store every night at he visits an all night diner to drink tea and read classic novels here he meets a young prostitute played well by the always good chloe grace moretz of course bad things eventually happen to the girl her pimps are russian mafia guys are the personification of evil denzel to the rescue over the next two hours the action is standard stuff which we have seen before but denzel makes it worthwhile a bit too long at two hours and twelve minutes with typical villains it is nevertheless entertaining enough to recommend as a good nights distraction a,0.705,1
"'When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.'",gradyharp,2 January 2015,None,antoine fuqua training day shooter olympus has fallen etc has rethought and adopted the television series by the same name michael sloan and richard lindheim with a script by richard wenk into a movie that is so well made that it shows every actor in the film at hisher best yes it is violent but the violence is directed at those evil men who benefit from the misery of others never being arrested and never submitting to punishment robert mccall denzel washington in one of his finest roles believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and has dedicated himself to beginning a new quiet life in boston massachusetts he is methodical and supportive and works at the home mart store frequently helping his coworkers every night mccall goes to a diner to read a book and drink tea and he befriends the teenager russian prostitute teri chloë grace moretz the alias of alina one night alinas pimp slavi david meunier brutally beats her and she goes to the intensive care unit icu of the local hospital mccall goes to the russian restaurant where slavi is and offers us for the freedom of alina however slavi does not accept the offer and mccall kills him and his four bodyguards the russian mafia kingpin vladimir pushkin sends the cruel enforcer teddy marton csokas in an exceptionally fine performance to find who killed his men soon he finds that mccall is the one who killed the mobster and teddy begins a war against him mccall may have a mysterious past but he has become a robin hood hit man who destroys those people who prey on others and in doing so he changes the lives of those for whom he is the benefactor the plot is appropriately complex involving bad cops the fbi the russian gangs and their multiple crime influences of human and drug and oil trafficking the excellent cast includes johnny skourtis as ralphie the obese lad robert mccall guides to a better life melissa leo in a very brief but poignant role bill pullman david harbour haley bennett etc after a fine and tense drama the film is all but ruined by the wholly unnecessary noisy rap music that destroys the mood during the credits despite this this is a very fine film overlooked for some reason,-0.987,0
Just roll with the flava,confidencebeats,11 July 2016,None,this movie is a cross between the professional and taken dont get caught up with hollywood and russian stereotypes and so forth just enjoy some good ol entertainment and action thats what were paying for right this movie was amazing i loved both the movies mentioned above so why wouldnt i love this one this is even better because denzel is so cool calm and collected throughout the whole movie which makes him even more of a bad ass he cant lose all in all this one is a keeper for me and will be watching this again and again over the years slow to start but once it does the action and dialogue is great,0.9644,1
we are magpies now?,destinedsleep,2 May 2015,None,it is shiny it has glitter it had logic it has denzel appearing intelligent with reading books its not what the opening leads you to believe no we are sucked in with minutes of we might have cool and suave mixed with some believable action fool me once instead i watch this highly trained unbeatable assassinhand to hand combat best the cia ever trained warrior who from what the movie will have us believe the whos who of who in society and military world over would consider themselves privileged to get a decline to their respective rspvs to their daughters wedding blows up a ship by remote control or timer but is casually strolling away while shrapnel is penetrating shipping containers all around him not that strolling away while your explosives are about to probably kill you is dumb or anything cause he has great intuitiveness like with the whore there are lol a few other moments i could waste my finger on but why if you defend this as a good film then you probably never knew why pink floyd were so great and i cannot hold any credibility for something that holds so little taste for art getting back to our denzel character if i didnt think this guy was a tool before blowing up the shipping container so casually he comes out of retirement for a white trash hooker some professional or maybe i got hookers wrong maybe hollywood have an insight i have misconceived and most are really sweethearts who need to be nurtured into the butterflies they always were top,0.9548,1
I liked this until he pulls out a Hilti DX 351,blackriverrt3,31 December 2014,None,this movie was really good but my knowledge of the gun he uses in the final scene ruined it for me a powder actuated fastening tool doesnt cut it with me for a firearmsorry you can even see the strip of nails in it enough of that the movie makers just dont know when to quit and take the last sliver of believeability out of it when they try this sort of thing at least use a real firearm or a prop that mocks a firearm not a nail gun that doesnt shoot nails unless you compressed directly on somethingeven then they are low velocity i guess they succeeded in bluffing this part was too mel gibson and danny glover copy cat for shooting the bad guy with a nail gun for meoutside of that last bit the movie rocked,-0.9458,0
Quintessential Denzel Washington!,m1965,16 January 2015,None,for those of you like me who like a real action flick every now and then to vicariously live out the life you wish you could lead this is it there are a handful of action stars that really deliver the goods from time to time denzel washington is one of them and this is one of his best if not the best hes ever made this occurs for many reasons but here are a few of the prominent ones writing acting and the actors involved the story here isnt new but when vengeance is dont right its to be savored its nice when a veteran actor like denzel doesnt stray too far from what got him in hollywoods alist to begin with if you like action flicks and love denzel washington this movie will not disappoint its perfect on many levels special recognition must go to chloë grace moretz for her superb performance,0.9908,1
"Silent, brooding and Kick-ass",Asurasura,15 November 2014,None,i liked the movie i enjoyed its entire run time except the finale it spoiled the entire build up of the story if the villain killed some of the home depot employees it would have ended spectacularly but we get too much of deus ex machina vibe in the end one man cant save everyone sometimes when a wars started there will be casualties denzel may be calm precise and deadly but he too cant kill people with a single sniper shot chloe graces acting was good but i liked the actress who played chloes friend she really looked the part this is not a full blow by blow action movie i realized when i saw the trailer that i have to savor the silence and enjoy the mayhem becacuse silence increases the violence level,0.9405,1
What about Bob?,sesht,22 November 2014,None,perhaps one of the most slickly done mainstream action movies out there in a dying genre that i recommend it on those genrerelated merits alone though it couldve been done way wayyyy better the first hour spends time setting the main characters up and thats the best part about this flick sadly contentwise that is important to note here its all downhill from that point on and becomes a bythenumbers vigilantes vendetta flick denzels on call and the loneliness of his character is beautifully realized here but that character is called upon to perform so many acts that are beyond the realm of suspensionofdisbelief that few viewers have compared this one to steven seagal flicks more on that later what this movie has got going for it in spades is sheer style and chutzpah a word grossly misused for effect in a recent overrated local flick each action setpiece is preceded by mccall cam borrowing intentionally or not from guy ritchies rendering of sherlock holmescam and that novelty factor for most wore out its welcome after the first time though the technical effort expended whenever it is used is exemplary the cinematography and the soundtrack is some of the best to grace the screen this year and in the case of the latter there is one track that fits a particular action setpiece so well that its presence along with its companion action sequence almost redeemed the lazy bollywood hi jinks resorted to by the makers for most of its running time slomo focus on the lead really we get it butreally there is also a point after which its not just the leads invincibility that gets hammered into us but also the inanity and the predictability of it all that is only redeemed by the style on display antoine fuqua with this has returned to the replacement killers territory which though slick and technically proficient for its time was equally plagued with every action cliché that acts as a checklist item for most of its ilk though thankfully falling just short of corny transporter or fast and furious territory for that much effort id gladly handle multiple viewings of movies like this rather than transporter or fast and furious his takenoprisoners style also mirrors his approach in olympus has fallen coincidentally butler was also considered for the mccall role i wish the movie had continued to include a key character who precipitates everything that happens in this flick throughout rather than dispense with himher and then only bring himher back at the end i was like huh did i miss something haley bennett music lyrics has a change of scene here and acquits herself well the spare quick brutal and realistic for the most part manoamano fight sequences seem to be used aikido moves for the most part and this more than anything else perhaps has prompted a few viewers to make comparisons to steven seagull flicks after having watched this one i wouldnt cover them all but am sure that the final setpiece between seagal and tommy lee jones in under siege was a definite inspiration of sorts to the action choreographerdirector and it is undeniably effective and is a welcome technique id watch this again just to enjoy the setpiece i spoke of and the cinematography soundtrack but still feel that the movie couldve been better than what it turned out to be i think theres the inevitable sequel coming esp since the box office for this has been decent and hope they fix what needs fixing for that one at least,0.9912,1
